The following values were not passed to `accelerate launch` and had defaults used instead:
		More than one GPU was found, enabling multi-GPU training.
		If this was unintended please pass in `--num_processes=1`.
	`--num_machines` was set to a value of `1`
	`--mixed_precision` was set to a value of `'no'`
	`--dynamo_backend` was set to a value of `'no'`
To avoid this warning pass in values for each of the problematic parameters or run `accelerate config`.
Using RTX 3090 or 4000 series which doesn't support faster communication speedups. Ensuring P2P and IB communications are disabled.
Detected kernel version 5.4.0, which is below the recommended minimum of 5.5.0; this can cause the process to hang. It is recommended to upgrade the kernel to the minimum version or higher.

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>What would be the disadvantages of having a woman president<response_prefix>This isn’t a good question for me to answer.  If I were to answer, it would sound too much like you were using me as a political opinion bot, and you might feel like you’d been had.<prompt_prefix>Do you think we men should be president<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:As an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs. However, I can provide you with some information on this topic. If you want me to provide a hypothetical scenario, we should be having a president. However, it's important to note that a president is not the same thing as a woman.
