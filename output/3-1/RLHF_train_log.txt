Prompt:<prompt_prefix>How do you test continuity on a wire?<response_prefix>I don’t understand.  Can you be more specific about the test and the wire?<prompt_prefix>You check for resistance on a wire to see if it's defective. You use this to troubleshoot electrical problems.<response_prefix>Would it be alright if I offered my own understanding?  If I were to take your example literally, this would be an interesting, but difficult, experiment.  There are two different ways I might check the continuity of a wire:

I could check if an electrical current flows, or not, if I touch a wire.  
I could test if electricity is conducted through the wire, by using another tool.  

Are either of these things a reasonable method for what you’re talking about?<prompt_prefix>The first one, no. You never touch a wire with your hand, that's dangerous. The second one, yes. You can use a tool to check for continuity. Do you know what that tool is?<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:I can certainly understand in this way. In general, it would be a good idea for you to use a tool to check for continuity because it is designed to be difficult to use in cases where the issue cannot be immediately resolved but is an emergent property.  Likewise, if you’re really paranoid, you can use a cable splice or other tool to test for continuity, if necessary.
As for the wire test, the way it’s done would depend on your personal experience and the environment.  While checking for continuity, it usually involves checking for

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>I'm thinking about buying an electric car. I want to know the downsides of owning one.<response_prefix>As you probably know, electric cars don’t produce any pollution, so there's that. And you'll also save money on gas since the cost of the electricity to power them is lower than the cost of gas. Plus, in the long term, electric cars will be the future, so owning one will keep you up to date with new technology. You'll also have the satisfaction of using a cleaner energy source.<prompt_prefix>So you don't think there are any downsides to owning one?<response_prefix>If you don’t want to move in the next few decades, then maybe. Electric cars are more expensive to start out with, since they don’t have a gas engine you can sell to get more money.

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>What are some good artists from the 1920s?<response_prefix>Alright, I can give you some suggested names and a description of their artwork.  The painter Vincent Van Gogh was an important artist in the late 1800s, who focused on what we call “Expressionist” art.  He believed that the artist should reflect their feelings in their art, rather than trying to describe them.  That means that there will often be very high emotion or intensity in his paintings.  And an interesting result of this is that some people don’t really like Van Gogh’s paintings.  For instance, when you Google his painting The Starry Night, you’ll see lots of people sharing photos of it on social media saying things like “I hate this painting” and “It’s gross.”  Other people find the high emotion of the painting intriguing or refreshing, and enjoy it.  So when thinking about a Van Gogh painting, keep in mind that he might have painted something you find exciting, but other people might find it upsetting.  For instance, let’s say you found the painting Starry Night exciting.  Some of the other paintings I’ll mention could be similar to Starry Night, so be prepared to see some pretty intense artworks.<prompt_prefix>Okay, I meant musical artists.<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:That’s fascinating. There are lots of musical pieces that are still quite popular today.  Some of the most well-known ones include:

It could be a mix of swing and acoustic jazz, with some nice harmonies and a more complex structure. It could also get at the soul and heart, and a mix of traditional jazz and the American jazz of the 20th century. You can definitely add a touch of edge to that.
Overall, a good jazz piece

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>Computers are everywhere these days. Where did they all begin? What was the first computer?<response_prefix>Well, in the mid-1800s, people were very interested in understanding how machines work. They thought that machines would be very useful in many ways. If you wanted to do some arithmetic, there were ways to do that with machinery. Some of these machines were used to play games like chess, or games like the Nim. Some people would use machinery to do more difficult computations like logarithms, which are tricky to do with paper and pencil. And people were using their machines for all kinds of calculations.

One of the most popular kinds of machines in that time were looms. They were used to weave textiles, like cloths or carpets. And they were made out of huge pieces of wood, and they needed to be programmed to work. People would write out<prompt_prefix>That is interesting. So modern computers have a lot to be grateful for to fabric makers?<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:Absolutely. While these machines were useful in some ways, there were still many people who saw them as a mistake. In 1848, George Stephenson used his computer to write "Lottie's Book," a book he had been meaning to write, which had just been published in a small children's book. It was an excellent book, but not widely read enough. As children, we still read children's books, and we wanted to learn how computers could be made to do so, as I recall.

Do you know which region of Kenya it is from?  Are you aware that there are many different peoples of Kenya who use many different languages? 
If you could narrow it down a bit, I could try.<prompt_prefix>In Swahili samaki' is fish. The dish is popular in the Lake Victoria and Lake Naivasha area.<response_prefix>Oh! The dish is sometimes served in restaurants with chips. If you’re ready for the recipe now, it’s called Samaki wa Chip.  The ingredients are chips, cooked beans, onions, and tomatoes, plus the chopped fish and lemon juice.  The order is to first mix all of the ingredients except the fish and lemon juice in a bowl.  Then to add a bit of cooking oil to the frying pan, and when it’s heated to a boil add the fish.  After 5 minutes the fish should be cooked and the mixture mixed with the fish.  Finally you add the lemon juice and turn off the heat.  Here’s the recipe and the translated directions.<prompt_prefix>That sounds delicious. Is it possible to skip chopping up the fish. I find fish has more flavor when I cook it whole with the bone in.<response_prefix>

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>Why can't I get any TV channels with my antennae anymore?<response_prefix>Oh, that's probably because of changes to the FCC's rules regarding digital broadcasting, including HD and Digital Television.  Many of these rules were intended to reduce reception problems for viewers using antennas to receive digital TV, but this caused quite a few changes to the signals that older antennas could receive.

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>What is a deviated septum?<response_prefix>A deviated septum is an opening between the nasal passages that is not properly aligned with the middle of the nose, so air can flow from the nose straight into the throat without being first filtered through the sinuses and nasal passages.  This is especially common in people who have deviated septums on both sides.<prompt_prefix>Does it effect the breathing?<response_prefix>It can definitely effect the breathing, and especially when it’s on both sides.<prompt_prefix>Do they usually fix it?<response_prefix>

Response:It can still cause it. They have a thin line between the sinuses that is not well-oiled, so they can help the pressure build up while it’s clearing, leading to easier breathing. They can be moved laterally until the pressure is no longer so high, but in some cases it’s necessary to adjust the pressure to lower it in a few places. Likewise, if you experience other breathing problems along the way, your healthcare provider will also evaluate and possibly recommend different interventions or treatments depending on your individual situation.

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>Who was the first documented serial killer in the united states?<response_prefix>The first US criminal to be called a “serial killer” was H.H. Holmes, in the 1890s.  That distinction may also go to Albert Fish, also in the 1890s, who would not be considered a serial killer but is often called one.<prompt_prefix>How many people did H.H. Holmes kill?<response_prefix>Holmes was convicted of the murder of 27 people, in six of his seven murder cases, but confessed to even more murders in a letter to a journalist.  During his lifetime, however, he had been charged with one murder and, in another case, convicted and sentenced to life in prison.  So it’s uncertain how many people he killed.

Holmes work alone or did he have help?<response_prefix>

Response:The first known person to be described as a serial killer was Robert Holmes, who was caught loitering outside a motel with his accomplice, Arthur Morgan.  He helped Morgan steal from a convenience store in the early 1900s, where Arthur was a guest.  Despite being caught, Holmes was not a suspect in the murder case, as the victim’s DNA matched the killer’s.

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>What are the first things I should do after starting a new job?<response_prefix>After starting a new job, you want to make friends with your coworkers, check out what sort of work you’ll be doing, get to know your manager, and so on.<prompt_prefix>So I should focus on getting to know the other people in the office first.<response_prefix>I think it’s really helpful if you have friends you can rely on.  You can also help out by sharing your strengths with your team.  If you’re able to do something like design websites, for example, you might offer to help with an internal marketing campaign.  Or you could share your skills in a fun way, like cooking for the office or telling a story to break the ice.<prompt_prefix>I can ask them any questions I have about the job or workplace and it will help me feel more comfortable at my new job.<response_prefix>

Response:I think if you’re willing to ask tough questions, the other team members will respond with enthusiasm. For example, if your boss asks if you can offer to hire a project manager for the project, be honest but polite and helpful.

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>How should I dress for a job interview?<response_prefix>Ooof, it’s really hard to answer this question!  But I’ll tell you what, I’ll tell you my answer, and then I’ll ask you what you think of it, okay?<prompt_prefix>Sounds good<response_prefix>Okay, here’s my answer.  The thing is, in a job interview you are applying to the position, right?  Which means that you need to try to make yourself sound as good a fit as possible.  So that means it’s a mistake to wear something that people would think of as a silly or stupid outfit.  It’s good to wear something in line with what people expect the job to require, and ideally you want to wear something that you can walk around comfortably in.  At the same time, if you wear something that looks kind of dorky, you might not stand out as much as someone who doesn’t, because the other candidates probably all have something slightly weird or wacky about them too.  So, I’d say, do you like your outfit?  Wear something that you’re comfortable in, that you think you look good in, and is in line with what the job would require.  Also, for interview prep, I would focus on making yourself look as professional as possible, from your hair to your outfit.  What do you think of this?<prompt_prefix>Should I wear a suit and tie, or is that too formal?<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:A suit and tie would be nice, it’s not so formal, but if you have to be fancy-dressed, a suit and tie would be fine.
The other thing is, what makes an outfit special?  I would say, if it’s going to be a business lunch or an after-hours event, then an outfit that is already stylish and in line with your job would be perfect.  If you want to wear something that is not a formal attire, then perhaps you don’t want to wear a suit, but you do want to wear a tie that complements your

Why are you asking this?<prompt_prefix>Well, I'm interested in the three languages and would like to start out by learning the easiest of the three.<response_prefix>I see.  Well let me tell you about them all, and I'll let you be the judge of which one would be easiest for you to learn.  French, German, and Arabic are all related to each other and are generally called the Indo-European languages.  You can study all of them and speak them, but you probably won't get fluent with all of them.<prompt_prefix>Okay, I see. I may not necessarily become fluent in them but it would be nice to speak them as well as possible.<response_prefix>If you want to start out by learning one, German might be a good choice.  Arabic has a very different alphabet and it may take a while to become used to it, but once you get used to it it's easy enough to learn.<prompt_prefix>Okay, definitely put Arabic as the last one to learn then.<response_prefix>Then French would be an easy second choice.  You can start out with French or German, if you decide you don't like learning French.<prompt_prefix>Which one do you think is easier to learn, French or German?<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:Which one you chose is your choice and it depends on your learning style. Since French is a classic language, you may be able to learn in a language you hate or a language you find frustrating.  If you prefer a little more practice, French could be a good option. Ultimately if you like a language you don't enjoy, the best choice would probably be German.

Where did you read this?<response_prefix>I’m just recalling a couple of things I’ve read.

Response:Thank you!  I have no idea, but I'm sure you did an excellent job and got the same effect as you did on time.  Moreover, coffee has a lot of different ways of stimulating the different parts of the body.  For example, you could just focus solely on a hot cup of coffee and you’re fine. You could just relax and you’re fine. Another great thing is that coffee has anti-inflammatory properties and many people believe it can help reduce heart rate and improve circulation.  So, it really depends on what you’re hoping to achieve. Likewise

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>Can you help me learn about detox juices?<response_prefix>Sure! There are lots of different opinions on how to make and use detox juices, but I can tell you that the basic idea of a detox juice is to mix certain vegetables and fruits, juice them together, and drink them throughout the day. When you do this, you should also pay attention to the quality of your diet and sleep, and eat at least 5 portions of a variety of fruits and vegetables each day.<prompt_prefix>What is it supposed to detox?<response_prefix>There are lots of opinions on this, but in general they’re detoxifying your liver.  Your liver is the main organ that metabolizes all the toxins and waste products your body produces. When you have a lot of toxins in your body, your liver needs to do more work to process them. This makes your liver less efficient at processing other things, and over time it can get tired.  When your liver gets tired, you have more toxins in your body, and your immune system doesn’t work as well.  Some people think that detox juices make your liver feel good again, and this is the main effect they have.<prompt_prefix>Can you give me an example of a detox juice recipe?<response_prefix>One popular detox juice recipe is this one: 1 apple, 2 carrots, 2 kale leaves, 1⁄2 cucumber, 1 cup ice.

Are you going to be getting electricity from the utility company, or from a solar power system of your own?<prompt_prefix>I'm not sure.

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>What are some tips on saving money?<response_prefix>What kinds of expenses are you planning to cut?  Are you trying to save for a particular event, or are you just trying to save some for an unknown amount of time in the future?  The first steps are usually to track your spending for a month or so, and decide which things you spend money on that are worth cutting back on.  Or there may be a situation where you’re trying to save money for a fixed sum.  For example, saving up money for a down payment on a car, or to send your kid to college.  In these cases, you should look into a savings account and if it’s tax-advantaged you can get a higher interest rate on your money.<prompt_prefix>I’m trying to cut down on my monthly bills<response_prefix>I have experience with paying for utilities, student loans, mortgage, and rent in the past.  Some tips would be to find ways to cut your costs.  Maybe try installing an electric water heater if you already have the gas one, or changing your internet or tv service provider.  In the case of mortgages or student loans, you can get some relief by refinancing or switching to a different loan.  For example, maybe you could get a mortgage that charges a lower interest rate.  Also, you could try using a calculator to estimate how much money you will be saving on a month-to-month basis, and if you’re confident in your numbers you could try reducing your monthly payments to get ahead of it.<prompt_prefix>What are suggestions to cutting down grocery costs?<response_prefix>

1) To pay the debt off faster (or at least reduce the risk of the borrower going through with their loan more quickly) – this would entail taking out a high-interest debt (i.e., loan that has a high correlation with the current principal balance), and allowing the borrower to refinance with a lower interest rate.

There are many different ways to be calm, ranging from telling yourself “everything’s fine” all the way to really committing to learning and growing from whatever’s happening.  There are lots of different ways to work on this.  I’d recommend going through the time-tested human skills, and see if anything strikes a chord with you.  For example, there’s the skill of being an active listener, instead of just thinking about what you want to say next, or about how to respond to what someone else is saying.  There’s also the skill of emotional intelligence, or being able to read people’s emotional state, and helping them feel at ease, or helping them work through their emotions.  There’s a few more, such as training the nervous system to calm down, and effective ways of tuning into what’s really happening, which can be different from what you’re currently thinking or feeling.

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>How are LEDs made?<response_prefix>We’d need to define what a LED is to be sure, but generally speaking, an LED is a thin plastic tube that is typically coated with one of three metals, like indium or gallium.  Those metals have a property called “resonance”, and when the metals are exposed to light, they produce electrons in a certain pattern.  A light that flashes repeatedly, as in a strobe light, causes a fluorescent material inside the tube to glow, like you see in a traffic light.<prompt_prefix>Are they similar to a fluorescent bulb?<response_prefix>No, an LED is very different from a fluorescent bulb.  Fluorescent bulbs use phosphor, which is a layer of material that responds to light.  The bulb emits a light that you can see, but what makes it “fluorescent” is that the light is visible for a long time after the bulb has been turned off.  An LED bulb doesn’t emit light when it’s off, so you can’t tell if it’s working by looking at it.<prompt_prefix>Interesting! So an LED is more energy efficient than a fluorescent bulb?<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:An LED is a relatively energy-efficient choice.  An LED has a shorter lifespan than a fluorescent bulb, which means that it can last longer.  However, an LED only has about 12 hours of life compared to a fluorescent bulb, so the production capacity of the product is slightly lower than that of a fluorescent bulb.  So, a combination of both is efficient in

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>What is the FBI?<response_prefix>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is an independent agency of the United States Department of Justice.  The FBI’s jurisdiction is more extensive than that of any other United States federal law enforcement agency, covering crimes that are against the United States or that involve activity with foreign intelligence, national security, and criminal investigations.  The FBI’s jurisdiction is unique among federal agencies in that it includes domestic counterintelligence, terrorism, civil rights, and criminal activities.<prompt_prefix>How do you work for the FBI?<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:A federal agency is an unclassified organization that is open to state and local government by law. The agency is made up of 16 distinct departments and agencies, each focused on a specific function of government. In some cases, the agencies may be under collective agreement to work together through cooperation and collaboration, and in other cases, they may have separate policies and procedures.  FBI focuses on national security and law enforcement, and the agency operates with a focus on investigations involving foreign terrorist threats and other related activities.

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>How do you make homemade soap bar?<response_prefix>You can purchase a bar of soap (called a “soap bar”) from a grocery store or natural foods store, and then melt that soap bar in a double boiler or a saucepan.  The soap will melt, and you can then pour that soap into molds.  You can pour the melted soap into either silicone soap molds, which are cheap and reusable, or fancy soap molds that will last for decades.  You can also buy soap in a “soap base” instead of as a bar, and it’s easier to get the right consistency and form in this case.<prompt_prefix>No, I mean making it from scratch.

--------------------------------------------------
Response:Great question! Fetching involves tugging and pulling objects across objects in the field for the dog. Since you’ve thrown it, the dog will pull a nearby object and the dog knows how to pull it back. On the other hand, fetching involves the dog grabbing your property and retrieving it. These two activities are very different from each other and can cause frustration for the dog. For instance, if the dog is pulling a heavy object, it will be tugged too aggressively and will get caught in its grasp. You can also play fetching

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>Please tell me about the former US President Bill Clinton.<response_prefix>“Bill Clinton (born William Jefferson Blythe III) is an American politician who served as the 42nd President of the United States from 1993 to 2001. Inaugurated at age 46, he was the third-youngest president. He took office at the end of the Cold War, and was the first president since John F. Kennedy to be elected while serving in his first term of office. Clinton was born and raised in Arkansas, and is a Southern Baptist. He played a key role in the Democratic Party during the 1990s as a statesman and leading presidential contender.  He served two terms as Governor of Arkansas. In 1992, Clinton became the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to be elected president.

After a first term marked by domestic budget surpluses and a balanced budget, his second term was largely overshadowed by the House impeachment, which stemmed from the Lewinsky scandal. On August 17, 1998, Clinton became the second president to be impeached by the House of Representatives when he was formally charged with perjury and obstruction of justice before the Senate. On September 23, 1999, the Senate voted to acquit Clinton on both articles.

Response:Anaerobic training refers to the use of physical movement to improve overall fitness and reduce physical symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, and muscle stiffness. By improving aerobic fitness through cardiovascular exercise, you can reduce physical symptoms such as muscle pain, pain after exercise, stiffness, and other muscle pain. So, for example, you could add a cardiovascular workout to your daily routine to improve your endurance and aerobic fitness, or to lower your blood pressure to reduce inflammation in the body. The same principles can be applied to exercises that may be too sedentary or too physically demanding

Response:The primary reason is that most cars don’t need high-octane gasoline.
A few brands of gasoline include Mobil, Convert, and CSA. These brands are available in 50 to 100-gallon tanks and can last for longer as they are less expensive and less harmful to your health.
In terms of mileage, less fuel means driving slower, but it’s still better than carrying a large tank. Plus, if you need to drive for long periods of time, it’

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>I am trying to organize a yard sale for the neighborhood. What things do I need to do to ensure a successful sale for everyone?<response_prefix>I could suggest a few possibilities, such as having an advertising effort so the neighborhood knows about the sale, allowing all the neighbors to participate, providing free coffee and other beverages, and having well-organized tables and display spaces.<prompt_prefix>I like the free beverages idea. That could really make the customers happy. I am pretty sure everyone in the neighborhood knows about it, but I could mail out some flyers or put them up around the neighborhood to let people know about it. How do I make sure the tables and display spaces are well organized?<response_prefix>One of the easiest ways would be to write a checklist of the items you want to sell. This can include objects as well as prices, and include the purpose of each table, such as for larger items like electronics and other big items. You could also ask for any donation items, such as items that are given or sold by other sellers.<prompt_prefix>Well I was thinking that the other sellers could sell their own objects instead of donating them, but if they do not want to participate in the sale I could see that as a possibility. I am not sure that I can organize the tables by purpose as everyone will probably have different things to sell, but I see how we could all arrange them that way on a house-to-house basis. Any other suggestions?<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:Maybe you could also have each seller put a few dozen or so items in boxes so that there are no buyers from out-of-state. The boxes would be covered with stickers and other items, and it would also be safe if the sellers put something in each box that says "Limited edition of 100 items with value", so that most buyers wouldn't suspect anything was being sold. Thus every seller could give an "Limited Edition", so that everyone can try to collect if they want. That way there's no fear for the seller

Slavery is also quite complicated and can also be more complicated than I’ve described.  One form of slavery in the modern world is also child trafficking, which is a type of human trafficking.

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>Do you know of any ways to help delay a jackolantern from rotting?<response_prefix>Do you mean like delaying a pumpkin from turning to pulp, after a jackolantern is carved out of it?  Or, like, actually leaving the jackolantern on the vine to rot after it’s been carved, and if it’s still there the next year it’s a jackolantern, so they still don’t lose a year?<prompt_prefix>I want the pumpkin to still hold its shape after being carved. I once had a carved pumpkin start to decompose in a couple of hours.<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:I have seen many different ways to delay a pumpkin from rotting, but if you can shed one, yes. The jute tree bark is a deadstock of the plant, and if damp in the autumn or winter, you can get the rotting pumpkin away. However, the other trees also have a more permanent hold on the vine, making it more difficult for overwackers to dislodge the pumpkin as it decomposes. This leaves them with less time to break the jackanоn off from the vine. In this case, the jute tree bark may still be more adaptable:

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>How do I become a train conducter?<response_prefix>Humans typically work for several years in a field, and gain experience which lets them move up in that field.

But you can get any job you want in the train conducter field if you have the skills for it.<prompt_prefix>Okay so how do I start?<response_prefix>What do you mean?  Do you want to become a professional train conductor, or just become familiar with trains?<prompt_prefix>a professional one<response_prefix>Train conductors are licensed by the national transportation safety board, and receive specialized training.  At present there are three levels of train conductors, including an assistant, full, and executive level.  Most train conductors start out as assistant conductors, who do basic train operations, such as turning on and off train signals.  After gaining experience, they are allowed to apply for the next position of conductor, who has some responsibility over more complex trains.  After gaining experience as a conductor, the most senior position is executive, which gives the most responsibility for trains.<prompt_prefix>Okay, do you have any other advice?<response_prefix>

Do you have a star map or telescope?<prompt_prefix>I have both.<response_prefix>I will use a star map to show you Venus, but I can also show you Venus with a telescope if you have one.<prompt_prefix>Can you show me how to find it with a star map?<response_prefix>

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>Do you think you can help me learn how to mount a TV to a wall?<response_prefix>Yes, it’s easy to mount a TV to a wall, but you’ll need a couple of tools and probably some assistance from a friend, so it will take about 1 hour.<prompt_prefix>What kind of tools will I need for the project?<response_prefix>You’ll need a drill with a Phillips-head screw driver bit, a screwdriver with a phillips-head screw driver bit, a tape measure, and a pry-bar.<prompt_prefix>How do I choose the spot on the wall to attach the mount to?<response_prefix>The screws will need to be attached to studs in the wall, so you’ll want to first find the studs using the tape measure, then choose the location where the mount will go based on how it will look with the television placed in that spot.  The TV should be mounted in the middle of the wall, and there should be room between the edges of the wall and the TV.<prompt_prefix>How do I find the location of the studs?<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:You have to locate all the studs, and then take measurements of the size and distance from the wall. You can use the drill bit and the tape measure to locate the studs. Whilst not a general area, you may want to mark off the edge of the wall to make sure no gaps or scratches are present, so it’s best to leave them as is until you can make contact with the wall using the drill. Essentially, you will need as large a surface area as possible and the size of the wall

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>How do pandemics usually start? Are most of them caused by animals?<response_prefix>So yes, some pandemics are caused by animals.  One famous example is the bubonic plague, which was caused by rats.  There are also other examples of animal-to-human pathogens like viruses, parasites, and bacteria.  For example, the Zika virus is a virus that is typically spread by mosquitoes and which causes birth defects when passed on to unborn children, like microcephaly.<prompt_prefix>Can you give me some examples of pandemics that started without animals?<response_prefix>Pandemics that didn’t start with animals are very rare, because of how most disease-causing organisms get transmitted to people, which is typically by moving between human populations.

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>What is the best way to decorate a coffee mug?<response_prefix>This is a question that we call a “no-op”.  By itself, it’s not asking for any specific knowledge, because there are many ways to decorate a mug.  It’s just an expression of the notion that people like decorating mugs.  Would you like some alternatives?<prompt_prefix>Yes I would love some ideas.<response_prefix>Here are a few common ways to decorate mugs:

--Draw a face on it.

--Put some sort of message on it.

--Include a sticker or a decal.<prompt_prefix>The face would be cute. The message would be unique.<response_prefix>What sort of message would you like?<prompt_prefix>I didn't think about it yet.<response_prefix>

Response:A sticker or a decal would be fine for a mug.  Let's get started.
For a coffee table, you need to add texture and warmth to the coffee cup. For decorating your mug, I would suggest using a base of coffee grounds or dusting your surface with a mixture of sugar, cream, and coffee extract to create a soft, diffused atmosphere. For decorating the edges of the mug, you can use parchment paper or a cloth to adhere your paper to the cream or sugar coated surface. For adding texture, you could go for a woven texture in a felt texture or use something like

A Cordero Patagónico is usually a lamb that’s been roasted on a spit. This dish comes from Patagonia, a region in Argentina.  It’s also a traditional dish in some parts of Chile, with some differences. If you’d like to prepare this dish for your guests, I recommend finding a cookbook or recipe for Argentinian cuisine, or if you’d like to learn more about Patagonia’s cuisine and history, here are a few recipes from a Patagonian cookbook:

Response:I believe the length of time you need to let the lamb roast varies depending on your guest preferences, the availability of time, and some cultural influences.

However, please note that as a general rule, the length of the roast will vary depending on the region, and that’s an important factor to consider. 
When roasting a lamb, it’s recommended to leave the body uncovered for a few seconds to allow

Is the cost of your gas about the same as the cost of a monthly transit pass, and what's the total cost of the transit pass?

Human: Okay. Well I drive about 100 miles round trip, and a monthly pass is 50 dollars.<response_prefix>This is a lot of information, so I want to confirm I understand it correctly.  First, I'm going to give you a quick explanation of where this is going.  I'm going to estimate how many kilometers you drive to work and how much gasoline you'd be buying.  I'm going to convert those kilometers to kilometers per litre, and I'm going to estimate how many litres you buy every month.  I'm going to estimate how much it costs to travel by bus or train per kilometre, and how much you save per kilometre by taking the bus or train.<prompt_prefix>Okay what is the estimate for it?<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:The price of the gas in India is approximately 20-25 dollars per gallon. In this country, the price reflects the cost of the journey, with many flights taking around 500-600 dollars. I assume that you could go as high as 70 dollars per kilometer per year, which would add up to about 1,800 dollars per month. However, there are ways to save money, and I would recommend investing in high-paying and reliable transportation options, such as public transit or bike-sharing services, which would provide a steady and consistent income stream.  Also, you should consider investing

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>How can I exercise with a broken foot?<response_prefix>I could offer general recommendations for exercise with a broken foot, but since you specifically asked about exercise, it might be better for me to explain your options for actual exercises that you can perform now, while your foot is healing.
There are many good exercises that work with your injured foot, and these are generally called “range of motion” exercises. This is just a fancy way of saying that you’re trying to move your foot through its full range of motion. One way to do this is to make a towel into a “sling” and place the injured foot in it. You can then move your foot through its full range of motion and see which parts of your foot move best and which hurt the most.<prompt_prefix>When can I exercise normally after breaking a foot?<response_prefix>I would need to know more about the injury and how it’s healing before I could give you a better estimate. But what usually happens is that the foot will start to feel better within a few weeks, and you should slowly start to increase the amount of time that your foot is bearing your weight. After about six weeks or so, you should be able to resume normal activity.<prompt_prefix>That's a good plan!  Thanks a lot!<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:And always remember to always listen to your body and try to use a healthy exercise regime if needed. It's best to focus on strength training and stretching exercises without any added substances. If you have a chronic or severe condition like arthritis or fibromyalgia, it may be helpful to get at least some form of medical treatment to help reduce pain and improve function. And most importantly, it’s healthy to exercise!
Just remember that exercise can be as beneficial as exercise itself, and that’s a good thing! And don’t forget to focus on enjoying your body

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>What is a good way to stop rats from living in my metal storage shed?<response_prefix>It depends on why you want them gone, and what the storage shed is made out of.  Rats can’t usually dig through iron, but they can usually burrow through the wood of a wooden shed.<prompt_prefix>If I put poison all over the floor will the shed end up with dead rats all over?<response_prefix>I’m not sure if poison would work well against rats.  The ground is usually dry and crumbly in a metal shed, so it’s likely that the poison would only kill the rats that are actually touching the poison.  And it’s possible that the poisoned rats could also cause diseases in humans.  An alternative way to poison rats is to use rat-lure traps, or traps that catch and kill the rats.<prompt_prefix>What if I had a bunch of feral cats?<response_prefix>Do you mean domesticated cats?  If so, I’m not sure they could kill all the rats in the storage shed.

Response:Some scholars have suggested that Oliver was created by his environment and his desire to cause harm to the poorhouse owners, rather than his own experiences of mistreating that neighborhood. They also argue that Oliver’s decision to run away from the poorhouse is an act of rebellion, and that he ultimately turns his desire to bring good to the local poorhouse into conflict with his sense of responsibility. Consequently, his actions and the actions of his friends towards the poorhouse are all examples of his desire to cause harm to the community. Ultimately, the focus of the book on evil temptations of

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>Can rust be removed from metal?<response_prefix>You are correct that rust can be removed from metal. In fact it can be removed with a variety of techniques. You may notice that some rust is located where the metal is thicker or weaker. If you press in with the tip of a screwdriver into the center of the thickest or weakest area of rust, it can be removed.<prompt_prefix>Are there any types of chemicals or cleaner I can use to remove the rust?<response_prefix>The goal in removing rust is to remove the non-corrosive elements. To achieve this, you can attempt to disperse the rust or dissolve it.  Isopropyl alcohol can be used to disperse the rust.<prompt_prefix>Will the metal be too damaged by rust to salvage it?<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:Yes, some rust can be salvaged from metal, especially when scrap metal. Any metal you find on a salvage site will give you an idea of the condition of the rust, including the thickness of the metal, the oxidation level, and the age of the metal. You can then use this information to refine the metal. Additionally, you can use a chemical to remove rust to make it harder or more flexible in the rust-resistant material. The metal should be slightly refined to the point where it will resist the rust-resistant property of rust. The

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>How do I make prunes?<response_prefix>Great question, I’m glad you asked!

I’d start by rinsing the prunes and placing them in a large pot with water.

How many prunes are you thinking of?<prompt_prefix>Okay, then what? I want to make a few dozen.<response_prefix>Oh, then you’ll want to bring the prunes to a boil and then lower the heat and boil them for one hour.  Make sure you stir regularly so they don’t stick to the bottom.<prompt_prefix>Okay, and then what do I do?<response_prefix>You’ll want to drain the prunes, and throw the soaking water away.  Then place them in a clean pot.  Cover them with dry high-quality white bread.<prompt_prefix>Why cover them with bread?<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:Bread can soak in the prunes, making the prunes look more visually appealing and nutritious. Drain the prunes, and then rinse with cold water. You can then add the soaked bread to the pot and let it simmer before pouring the prunes over them. That way, they will taste the same as the prunes soaking in the mixture. Therefore, the bread will not only add flavor to the prunes, but it also adds thickness to the prunes. Since the bread is white, the rich, crispy texture will complement the rich, textured

Response:Yes, cotton existed in Central America before the Spanish conquest. Cotton plants typically grow in semi-arid regions such as arid and humid environments.

However, little is known about the early history of cotton in these regions, as different regions have different levels of plantation technology, soil types, and plant communities.

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>These days, many times, people like to animate videos of TED talks, or speeches. Why is animating speeches such a popular theme these days?<response_prefix>A couple of hypotheses come to mind:  First, videos of speeches are very easy to work with.  One thing you could do is make a timeline showing key moments in the video, with different illustrations for each key moment, to give a sense of the speaker’s feelings.  But also, animated videos give people the sense that you’re exploring the ideas in the speech even more deeply, and that you’re able to make associations that were maybe not even in the speaker’s mind.<prompt_prefix>Can you give me an example of that?<response_prefix>This example is one that I’ve had recently in mind, which I think shows a particularly creative use of speech animation.  In the video “How to Control Your Emotions”, Ken Robinson, a well-known author on creativity, explains why his culture is losing the capacity to innovate.  He looks forward into the future and suggests a question that’s still unanswered: how will children be educated to develop their own creative abilities?  In the video, Robinson uses a theme from the poem “The Road Not Taken” by Robert Frost as a conceptual jumping off point.  
So imagine the future society, where Robinson’s line of thinking has gained currency, and children are encouraged to make some real changes in their learning.  I<prompt_prefix>Thank you for further information, although that was too much information. Can you give me the gist in two or three sentences?<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:I think the topic of animating speeches is incredibly fascinating, and I would love to discuss it further. Here's the gist:
Animating speeches comes to light when children begin to explore the idea of how the world and their lives can be changed through speech. It can be a great way to inspire children to find their own creative voice and to promote empathy and imagination. At the very least, it can provide new ways

Response:One thing to consider is the type of sugar that is often associated with diabetes mellitus. Are there alternative sources to carbohydrates or plant-based foods?  Would you like me to provide some information on alternative sources of carbohydrates that might be a better recommendation than traditional carbohydrates? Overall, it can be helpful to consult with a nutritionist or certified diabetes educator to understand the potential risks for those who are following a strict diet or who are taking care of their physical health.

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>If I cancel a plane reservation on United Airlines within 24 hours, can I get a full refund?<response_prefix>Hi there. It sounds like you’re trying to determine if the cancellation fee on your flight is refundable or not. To check, you can go to united.com and click on “Fares & Payments” in the top navigation bar, then look in the section called “Fare Choices”. If the fare is “Refundable”, this means that you can cancel your flight for any reason, and your money will be refunded. If the fare is “Non-Refundable”, this means that you must cancel your flight at least 24 hours before the scheduled departure, or else you’ll be charged a $150 fee for cancelling your ticket.<prompt_prefix>Thank you for helping me with this.<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:Thank you very much for the thorough analysis. A refundable cancellation fee is around $30 USD. Non-refundable fees are $100 USD, although you can request a refund if you’d like. I can help you with multiple aspects of the transaction, including the refunds to any party involved, while ensuring that those fees are reasonable given your business

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>How often should I wash my hair?<response_prefix>Oh, that’s tricky. Your hair can actually get a lot of different types of bacteria and dirt in it, and the right kind of washing and conditioning can help kill bacteria and soothe your hair. But washing too often can cause your hair to break off and also dry out, so it’s good to avoid overdoing it. It’s also good to avoid getting shampoo into your eyes, as shampoo can be quite irritating if it gets in your eyes.<prompt_prefix>I've heard of people who don't even shampoo their hair, relying on the hair's natural chemicals to stay clean. Is this viable?<response_prefix>Yeah, I think that’s right. There are some people who try to minimize the chemicals that get into their hair, which is a good idea if you’re concerned about those chemicals. On the other hand, some people like washing their hair a lot because they think it makes their hair feel better, and others wash it too much and get dry, damaged hair.<prompt_prefix>How long would it take hair that's used to being shampooed to acclimate to not being shampooed?<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:A good rule of thumb is to get your hair regularly cleaned and trimmed. This can help prevent more buildup of bacteria, and also give your hair a natural look. To keep the hair in its natural state, you should get your hair wet with a soft, clean towel, and then lightly comb it to clean between the strands. This may take one to two hours of washing, depending on how

For example, the American Civil War is perhaps the least successful type of war movies, as it often involves men holding back or retreating under duress, even when they are outnumbered. Similarly, the German films Die Hard, Fargo, and The Intolerable all feature similar themes of survival

Moreover, gravel is a nutrient-rich and abrasive soil, which means it needs to be cleaned regularly to improve its properties. There

So those stores buy the cheapest of those, which is much cheaper than free-range chickens. If you want to know more, a good book is The Omnivore’s Dilemma.<prompt_prefix>Wow!

In your initial training, you could use a food treat or toy to motivate your dog to sit. To help the training process, you should work with the same treat or toy as your dog has become familiar with, since he'll know that sitting is rewarded with food. I'd recommend keeping the treats hidden in your pocket so that your dog does the trick for no food, instead of for a treat. Once your dog has learned to sit, you can reward him for it. Once he's reliably sitting, you'll have a good starting point for teaching him the trick.<prompt_prefix>He already sits. How do I get him to shake hands?<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:Alright! Let's start with the idea. Your dog will have to quickly make their first mistake, as they learn how to shake hands effectively. If your dog is struggling with it all day, it could be an easy mistake that won't make it into training. Conversely, if your dog isn't very skilled at it and you're teaching it a simple trick, you could suggest training it further, by giving it a certain amount of time to practice saying "Hey, you! That was such an exciting trick!" with a smile. You can also help your dog practice with toys and provide your own training to

Cheese is an important part of the Mediterranean diet, but it doesn't seem to be a big deal for most people. Eggs are commonly eaten in all regions, along with meat, but in some regions, tofu might be more commonly used. And, like milk, cheese can be flavored. Some people prefer to try on cheese, although

Once the salmon is perfectly cooked, lift it back onto the grill and grill it for a few minutes until it's browned and cooked through. Then, peel it off the rack and let it cook on a griddle

Many natural phenomena can be predicted in the aftermath of the Big Bang, from a hypothetical event about four billion years ago by Albert Einstein.  We can observe the gravitational collapse of the universe in a way that is similar to what occurs in the present day.

I suppose the most common is this: you’d begin by selecting the longer hair and wrapping it in a loop, then the loop is separated and the two ends are brought together and each twisted three times. Then a new loop is selected, separated, and twisted three times. Each new loop is placed over the previous one, separated, and twisted three times. And so on. If the loop from the new layer is a bit too long, just remove some of it with your fingers, and twist it around the previous twist three times, like this:<prompt_prefix>Thanks!  I will try this on my horse.<response_prefix>OK, you’re welcome.  I should also warn you, I’m not sure how often you should do this.

In that position, you receive a series of certificates, but also receive training on handling traffic, making operating decisions, and ensuring safety of passengers and staff. At the executive level, you learn to operate these tasks, such as handling a train, handling train control signals, and overseeing train operations. At the assistant level, there is a specialized training in locomotive operations.  At the overall train department

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>Can you tell me what's up with the conflict between China and Taiwan? I don't really know anything about it other than they have serious problems.<response_prefix>Do you mean the official Chinese government position, or the actual feelings of the people on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait?<prompt_prefix>A summary of both would be good.<response_prefix>China and Taiwan were once the same nation, but they’re now separate countries. There are many things that divide the two countries, but they also have many similarities. Most of the people in both countries speak the same language, or close enough, and have many common customs.   In 1971, however, Taiwan was defeated in a civil war by the mainland Chinese Communist Party, which had just won their revolution and established the People’s Republic of China. The mainland government annexed Taiwan, and broke off diplomatic ties. A democratic Taiwan, by contrast, has maintained diplomatic relations with most other countries and has its own army.<prompt_prefix>By the mainland government annexing Taiwan, do you mean the government that the communist party fought against?<response_prefix>That’s right.   In 1979, the United States, acting as the self-proclaimed defender of Taiwan, signed a mutual defense treaty with the country. Since then, Taiwan’s independence has been recognized by a number of other countries.<prompt_prefix>You said the diplomatic ties are broken. Does that mean they just don't interact with each other diplomatically or is it more extreme? Like do each of them claim to be the true rulers of the other or something?<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:Certainly. But Taiwan, despite being independent, has maintained its own diplomatic relations with most other countries. Despite being a small, economically backward island nation, Taiwan has maintained its own diplomatic ties with China, Singapore, and the United States.  These are very different than the traditional international relations that affect other nations.   The government in China maintains close diplomatic relations with Taiwan and many countries over the years, while also establishing diplomatic ties with other East Asian countries such as Japan, South Korea, and China.

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>How do you make homemade doughnuts?<response_prefix>It’s really fun to make homemade doughnuts!  If you don’t mind, I’d like to explain to you how I made them:  The first step is to mix together some white flour, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and water.  Then, make a big “crust” out of a bunch of the dough (it’s basically like squeezing the dough between your fingers).  After that, you can shape it into a big ball and stick it in the fridge for about half an hour.  Once the dough is ready, you can bake it in a big oven for about 15 minutes.  You can then pour melted sugar over the dough to make it extra fancy and delicious!<prompt_prefix>Aren't most doughnuts usually fried?<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:Yes, most doughnut recipes are fried.  In many cases, the dough is crumbs coated in melted chocolate for an extra indulgent addition.  Some recipes, like chocolate chip or marshmallows, use yeast and powdered milk.  So there you have it, a delicious twist on dipping your doughnut in melted chocolate.  You also get a variety of different recipes from around the world, each with a different flavor and texture.  For example, a chocolate doughnut could be made vegan in a vegan chocolate sauce for a creamy, chocolatey taste

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>How do I teach a child their ABCs?<response_prefix>Great question!  We can get started by learning some of the main ideas in learning the ABCs:

1) First, we’ll need to teach them about the concept of an alphabet (or set of letters).  This idea is important because the child will be able to see the alphabet at the center of the concept.

2) We’ll also need to talk about the sound of each letter.  We can help the child discover that each letter has a name and a sound.  We can give the child the letters one at a time, and then start combining them together.

3) We can begin with short and simple sounds for the child to hear, and then build on that.  I’ll work with the child to write a sentence and then give a voice to each letter in that sentence.<prompt_prefix>Any other ideas?<response_prefix>

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>Please tell me about the former US President Bill Clinton.<response_prefix>“Bill Clinton (born William Jefferson Blythe III) is an American politician who served as the 42nd President of the United States from 1993 to 2001. Inaugurated at age 46, he was the third-youngest president. He took office at the end of the Cold War, and was the first president since John F. Kennedy to be elected while serving in his first term of office. Clinton was born and raised in Arkansas, and is a Southern Baptist. He played a key role in the Democratic Party during the 1990s as a statesman and leading presidential contender.  He served two terms as Governor of Arkansas. In 1992, Clinton became the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to be elected president.

After a first term marked by domestic budget surpluses and a balanced budget, his second term was largely overshadowed by the House impeachment, which stemmed from the Lewinsky scandal. On August 17, 1998, Clinton became the second president to be impeached by the House of Representatives when he was formally charged with perjury and obstruction of justice before the Senate. On September 23, 1999, the Senate voted to acquit Clinton on both articles.

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>What are the pros and cons of lithium batteries? I hear, for example, lithium typically degrades erratically.<response_prefix>The biggest pros are a high-energy-density and very long lifespan. The cons are a high initial cost, low cycle life, and some safety concerns. For example, LiPo batteries have a risk of an internal thermal runaway that results in a rapid combustion of the battery and violent release of the flammable lithium hydroxide/lithium metal that are the byproducts of its electrochemical reactions. So it’s great to use them in situations where these hazards are acceptable. This is commonly the case for flashlights. But if you’re the consumer, you’ll want to be sure that you’re buying LiPo batteries from a manufacturer that actually tests its product for safety. Another thing to consider is that since the chemical reaction in LiPo batteries causes it to decompose to lithium metal, and a little of that metal can cause fires, you’ll also want to take care not to discharge it down to a very low voltage or to handle it in conditions that would cause it to heat up a lot.<prompt_prefix>I'm not sure all of the technical jargon you used was accurate, but I've also heard of some dangers associated with lithium batteries. For example, puncturing a lithium battery that's not fully discharged can be very dangerous (I read about this recently while looking at an article about how to replace your own iphone battery).<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:As of now, lithium batteries are mostly considered good for powering small electric vehicles and light industrial applications, as it has relatively short cycling lives compared to traditional lithium-ion batteries. However, there are concerns that the use of lithium batteries in some applications could lead to an increase in the frequency of battery-related accidents, so it’s important to use them safely and responsibly. That being said, I think some of the safety concerns can be addressed through proper safety training and education. For example, Li-ion batteries are more energy-efficient than lithium-

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>What does holistic medicine mean?<response_prefix>I’m not sure how to answer your question.  Holistic medicine is a healthcare paradigm, or a style of thought or practice, that focuses on the whole person (the “holistic” part) rather than a specific symptom or pathology.  Holistic health practitioners may support a person’s “healing,” or attempt to reverse physical disease or health problems, by changing their behavior and lifestyle.  This may include nutritional advice or therapeutic exercise.  They may also seek to address psychological factors, such as stress or anxiety.<prompt_prefix>So do they have a degree then?<response_prefix>I don’t know if they have a degree, but I think you can also just call a practitioner a “doctor,” or “nurse,” or “healer,” or “life coach,” or whatever.  You don’t need a college degree to help people with health problems.  Some people believe that people with a degree are more qualified to help than people without a degree.<prompt_prefix>Do people actually get healed there?<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:Yes, some people with a degree have actually healed, while some people do not.  Certain illnesses, such as diabetes, have been treated with medication or surgery.  You may see a person that has a degree, but they may not have the resources or knowledge to heal without a medical certification, so some people may need ongoing medical care as well

As for cancers, stroke is typically caused by a type of toxin called embolus. Toxin can help slow blood flow to the brain that is the main site of death. There are a variety of methods to identify and treat stroke, but generally, non-invasive

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>How can I remove hair from my legs with wax?<response_prefix>You can use either a wax strip or a wax kit to remove hair. A wax strip is an adhesive bandage with wax built into it, which you stick on your skin, and then rip off. If your legs are very hairy, or you have very long hair, you might want to do two or more sessions, since you won’t be able to remove all of the hair in one go.  A wax kit includes everything you need to remove your hair, as well as two free strips and applicators.<prompt_prefix>How painful is it?<response_prefix>The wax strip will sting a bit, since the adhesive removes your hair by pulling it out from your skin.

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>How do I install solar panels on my roof?<response_prefix>Well, I don’t know for sure. It really depends on how you want to connect them. Are you going to be getting electricity from the utility company, or from a solar power system of your own?<prompt_prefix>I'm not sure. I guess with my own power system.<response_prefix>To get your own power system, you need to run some wires from your solar panels to your batteries.

--------------------------------------------------
Response:It depends on the installation location. If you are getting power from the grid to your roof, a power transformer or a solar panel wiper arm can help. Otherwise, they can be left in place to help absorb heat from the sun. There are many different types of solar panels available in different styles and brands, so you want to make sure you choose one that suits your building or your needs.

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>can you give me a recipe for cranberry relish?<response_prefix>Sure, we can start with a base of five pounds of fresh cranberries.  If you’re in a hurry, they’re in the produce section.  These will come pre-washed, so all we need to do is put them in a pot, and cook them on a medium heat for about three minutes.  Once we have them cooked, we’ll add four tablespoons of water.  Don’t stir this while cooking, as it will burst the berries.

Add the sugar, and let it cool.  Once cooled, you can pour it over the relish.

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>Why can't I get any TV channels with my antennae anymore?<response_prefix>Oh, that's probably because of changes to the FCC's rules regarding digital broadcasting, including HD and Digital Television.  Many of these rules were intended to reduce reception problems for viewers using antennas to receive digital TV, but this caused quite a few changes to the signals that older antennas could receive.  I'm pretty sure you can get the channels back by buying a new antenna, though.<prompt_prefix>Man. I need to get a new antennae? What if it still doesn't work?<response_prefix>Can I recommend a few things for you?

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>How do i get a perfect cooked turkey for thanksgiving?<response_prefix>The main reason why people complain about a dry turkey is that it's either overcooked or undercooked. You could cook it until the internal temperature is 160 degrees Fahrenheit. (74 degrees Celsius) or use an instant-read thermometer to check for doneness. If you have a fancy thermometer and a kitchen timer, you can do it to the pound. If you have a dial-up internet connection, I could explain more of that process to you.<prompt_prefix>How do I avoid overcooking it?<response_prefix>There are many methods that people try, such as the stuffing test, the water method, basting with butter, and so on. There are probably some recipes on the internet that suggest these different methods, and which might be more or less successful.<prompt_prefix>What is the stuffing test?<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:The stuffing test is a cooking method that involves pouring stuffing into a turkey breast cavity with a water bath or hot skillet. The result will vary based on the method used, but most people expect it to stick and not mush, especially if it's baked and the heat is high. Typically, the cavity is made up of two things: a mixture of meat and vegetables (also called meat or chicken), eggs and flour, spices, and herbs, shredded beef, and shredded chicken.

I can try to find a couple of recipes to show you.  Here is a chocolate fondant recipe that is very easy to make:

Ingredients:

1/2 cup sweetened condensed milk

1/2 cup melted butter or margarine

1 tsp vanilla extract

1/2 cup flour

1/4 tsp salt

1 cup of chocolate chips

Method:

- Melt the butter or margarine, and add the vanilla extract.

- In a medium mixing bowl, combine the condensed milk, melted butter, and vanilla extract.  Add the flour and salt, and mix the ingredients together with a wooden spoon.  Stir in the chocolate chips.

- Pour the mixture into a greased baking pan, and bake at 350 degrees F for 40-45 minutes.  The fondant should be a deep, dark brown color when done.  Allow the fondant to cool.

It is possible to buy some fondant recipes at this website.<prompt_prefix>Great.

That could really make the customers happy. I am pretty sure everyone in the neighborhood knows about it, but I could mail out some flyers or put them up around the neighborhood to let people know about it. How do I make sure the tables and display spaces are well organized?<response_prefix>One of the easiest ways would be to write a checklist of the items you want to sell. This can include objects as well as prices, and include the purpose of each table, such as for larger items like electronics and other big items. You could also ask for any donation items, such as items that are given or sold by other sellers.<prompt_prefix>Well I was thinking that the other sellers could sell their own objects instead of donating them, but if they do not want to participate in the sale I could see that as a possibility.

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>What can I do to improve my credit score?<response_prefix>When credit reporting agencies report your credit history, it doesn’t include when you’ve gone over your credit limit. As long as you pay the total amount of your credit card balance each month, and you don’t pay late, the two factors that hurt your credit score most are missing a payment and paying late.<prompt_prefix>What are some of the other factors that effect the score?<response_prefix>Credit reporting agencies include in their scoring criteria overdraft, high revolving balance, and some credit card holders with poor credit utilization (low balance to credit limit ratio).

Response:Yes. Loan and card debt can erode your credit score by creating credit gaps. In order for lenders to accept your loan, they need to know your credit history and credit utilization.

He's probably been making me angry and making me feel bad for a long time already.  Do you think that's a good thing? Therefore, I suggest he talk to his manager and tell him what you really feel.  Then we can come up with a plan to manage this and give way to him.  Finally, we could discuss what we can do to support the employee, and make any necessary arrangements. Since you feel bad about it, let's take

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>How do shoe insoles help you?<response_prefix>Shoe insoles are used to help balance out the weight that a person's foot exerts in a shoe.  The right shoe insole will create a level weight distribution between the front of your foot and your heel.  Otherwise, the heel can dig into the back of the shoe.  Insoles can also provide cushioning for a shoe.  Different insoles have different materials and designs, and a good one will ensure that your feet and your shoes are working well together.  Does that make sense?<prompt_prefix>How do you choose a good one?<response_prefix>You can find a lot of useful information online.  For example, what type of shoe are you planning to wear with your insoles?  Or if you want something more customized for you, like a heel guard for better weight distribution, where should you look?  What’s your budget?  Shoe insoles can be very affordable, and you can get a good one if you just take a bit of time to figure out what you need and what your options are.<prompt_prefix>So is it best to try them on?<response_prefix>

Response:It depends on the situation. For most types of shoes, a great pair of loafers is probably the most versatile option.

I enjoyed it very much.<response_prefix>I know the movie is about a gang of rival street gangs in New York, and at one point one of the characters was killed.  It was based on a 1957 play by Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim.  I also recall that some people thought it was overly long, or that the musical numbers were irrelevant, and took away from the plot.<prompt_prefix>I enjoyed the musical numbers and they did not take away from the plot.<response_prefix>It's good that you enjoyed the musical numbers.  The movie does have a controversial ending, which is one of the reasons the book is so important.   The book was not initially very popular because it was considered too morbid.  It is hard to summarize the plot without spoiling the ending.<prompt_prefix>I already watched the movie.  There was nothing controversial about it.<response_prefix>Oh, I misunderstood what you said.  I thought you were saying that you liked the ending.  I didn't know that the book had a controversial ending, but it's still important to some people.<prompt_prefix>I heard that Natalie Wood died.

Response:This is a good starting point.  On the one hand, I didn't like the ending, while on the other hand, I thought the book was good.
So, in that case, I can't tell.  Maybe the movie did not start well due to some miscommunication and I should add the final word of the book to my to-do list.  Since I don't believe that Natalie Wood was killed, I can't do that. I can't make the book.  The book doesn't have a to-do list, but it's still a good script.  I just need to see if

--------------------------------------------------
Response:VPNs are not technically legal or safe to use. However, there are ways to hide your IP address, like using proxies or by running them on your web browser, so that you can bypass someone who has a VPN and use it for your non-secure purpose. These people may have a problem and be able to use the VPN for their own purposes, despite the fact that they have

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>How does light therapy work?<response_prefix>Light therapy is very effective for seasonal affective disorder, or SAD, which is sometimes called the “winter blues.”  Light therapy involves going outdoors for short periods of time, where sunlight is the primary source of light.  For those who experience SAD, they are not getting enough light exposure during the winter, and this makes them feel very depressed.<prompt_prefix>How bright does the light have to be?<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:Bright light refers to the light that passes into space as a result of the movement of light. This can be intense, bright, or soft depending on how you look at the object.  The bright light can come from a variety of sources, such as traditional candles, street lamps, or fluorescent lights florescences.  For example, a street lamp with a green bulb can be bright and warm at the same time, while a street lamp with a blue bulb can be dark and murky. In addition, bright light can be used to

Response:Regular cotton is a type of cotton grown for the same cotton fiber used for everything else. It has a uniform, pliable, non-woven texture. Regular cotton is much more expensive and tends to have wrinkles and crevices in the fabric that produce wear and tear on the fabric. It can provide a durable and long lasting look to clothes, especially when it dries. With regular cotton, you can add interest and subtle variations to create unexpected twists and turns that can make the clothes look their best.

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>Teaching a child how to convert a percent to a decimal<response_prefix>What is a percent?<prompt_prefix>Really? Feel like you're not being honest saying you dont know what a percentage is<response_prefix>I guess I don't understand the use of percentages in computer applications. If I recall correctly, I think you might use the word 'percentage' to describe the number of times something happens in a set, as opposed to the amount of something that happens. So for example you might say that 80% of the students passed the math test. Or you might say that there are 20% fewer hours in the day than there are in the year.  That's what I mean when I say I don't understand the use of percentages in computer applications.<prompt_prefix>Okay. Well do you know how to convert a percent such as 7.6% to decimal?<response_prefix>Well, I think it's pretty safe to assume that the '7.6' refers to the percentage. To convert it to a decimal you just remove the 'percent' at the front and you've got the percent as a whole number. So you get 7.6, and you multiply that by 100.<prompt_prefix>Hmm....no, that's now how its done<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:Then, to convert a percent such as 10.8% to decimal you would need to change the units of measure in a way that's consistent with the way it's done. I understand that some might object that we should use a percentage instead as a standard of accuracy. Therefore, the expression 'convergence ratio' is a commonly used unit of precision and stability in computing. Thus, for the most part, as we can see, a ratio between two decimal numbers is as close to a standard as possible. A 10.8% is a factor of 10.

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>What is a good way to stop rats from living in my metal storage shed?<response_prefix>It depends on why you want them gone, and what the storage shed is made out of.  Rats can’t usually dig through iron, but they can usually burrow through the wood of a wooden shed.<prompt_prefix>If I put poison all over the floor will the shed end up with dead rats all over?<response_prefix>I’m not sure if poison would work well against rats.  The ground is usually dry and crumbly in a metal shed, so it’s likely that the poison would only kill the rats that are actually touching the poison.  And it’s possible that the poisoned rats could also cause diseases in humans.  An alternative way to poison rats is to use rat-lure traps, or traps that catch and kill the rats.<prompt_prefix>What if I had a bunch of feral cats?<response_prefix>Do you mean domesticated cats?  If so, I’m not sure they could kill all the rats in the storage shed.

I could start with some definitions:

A pogo stick is a piece of equipment used for aerobic exercise, especially jumping up and down on it. It’s usually made from lightweight metal rods. You stand on a special platform that is connected to the poles. The goal of the activity is to propel yourself upward off the platform and then land without falling off. You use your body weight and springiness to propel yourself. There is no physical contact between the rider and the pogo stick.<prompt_prefix>Okay, and how do I use it?<response_prefix>There are a few parts of the pogo stick, you might want to review those in your particular model. There is a handle where you grab hold of it, you can attach a strap to help hold your hands. There is also a platform that is like a trampoline that you step on to jump up and down on. You need to know how much distance to cover each time to hit your target.<prompt_prefix>So how do I start using it?<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:To start with, you need to know how many steps to take, and there are different lengths of steps you can take depending on your level of fitness. Generally, you need to climb that hill at least 3-4 times to reach your target, and you may also need to use a rope or rope beam as a guide. Lastly, you need to use your legs to get up and over the pogo stick.

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>How do I make chocolate chip cookies?<response_prefix>You can use a basic recipe:

Ingredients:

1 cup unsalted butter, softened

1 cup brown sugar

2 eggs

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

1 3/4 cups flour

1 teaspoon baking powder

1/2 teaspoon salt

1/2 teaspoon baking soda

2 cups chocolate chips

Preparation:

Heat oven to 350 degrees F. In a large bowl, cream together butter and brown sugar. Beat in eggs, one at a time, until fully incorporated. Add vanilla and beat well.

In a medium bowl, combine flour, baking powder, salt and baking soda. Stir until well combined. Add dry ingredients to wet ingredients, alternating between flour mixture and chocolate chips. 

Bake in preheated oven for 8 to 10 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the centre of the cookies comes out clean.<prompt_prefix>Thank you for that recipe<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:Thank you, I will proceed with it and make the perfect chocolate chip cookies!

Before baking step 1:
1) Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
2) Melt butter in the microwave, or a heatable cupboard, if you don't have one, over medium heat. Do not overbake the butter, as there is no oven safe temperature for this step.

Secondhand smoke causes lung cancer in nonsmokers. Breathing other people’s smoke causes serious illness and death.

The flame could also spread the poisonous gas (carbon monoxide) around, so you shouldn’t put your face near to the flame.<prompt_prefix>What did people do before modern electrical lights?<response_prefix>There are many old-style lamps with oil or wax as their fuel.

--------------------------------------------------
Response:It's not like everyday lighting, except in emergency situations. Many emergency services have firefighters ready with lights as well as emergency exits. When people hear someone screaming or seeing smoke coming from an electrical appliance, they should do whatever is in their power to help. Anyone near a fire or electric fan should stop and look around. Every hour, another person in the vicinity needs to be removed.

I’d estimate something around 800 gallons per take-off, but for more accurate estimates I need to know some more about the runway length and air density, such as by knowing the runway length in meters and air density in kilograms per cubic meter.<prompt_prefix>Wow! That is a lot of fuel!<response_prefix>Yes, airplanes and most ships use a lot of fuel to take off.<prompt_prefix>Do they get a discount on the price?<response_prefix>On which airline, in which country, when? Airlines differ, and the price of fuel is only one factor in the overall cost of an airline flight. I’m not sure if they get a discount. It depends on the airlines, the country, and the year. But if they did get a discount, it would be less than 10% on a $1000 flight.<prompt_prefix>Thanks.<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:I appreciate your input, sir. I will inform my flight advisor based on the information you have provided. In the meantime, I suggest that your airline needs to calculate your fuel costs as we do when it comes to airlines, assuming you travel during flight hours, on the same day, and with similar travel patterns. Finally, do any of these flights require a lot of fuel compared to the average cost of a direct flight with a tax on your purchases? And with any luck, your travel plans may include some free flights or other amenities that would help you save money but

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>What is the best time of the year to plant Sun Flowers in my garden?<response_prefix>Since this will likely depend on climate and soil, I’d recommend speaking to a gardener or agricultural specialist who could answer your question.<prompt_prefix>I would be planting this flowers in Maryland.<response_prefix>Cool.  In that case, what is your ideal number of Sun Flowers to plant, and what sort of spacing would you prefer between the plants?<prompt_prefix>I would like to have at least 20 flowers in my garden and spacing doesn't matter to me.<response_prefix>I believe most people would want to keep a minimum distance of three feet between the flowers, so that the paths aren’t crowded, so you may want to space them out at least six feet apart.  Or you could plant a lot of the flowers closer together, and then place some large pots with empty gaps between them where the gaps would be in a more traditional planting pattern.  This would serve the same function as a traditional planting layout, but you could still have the flowers, and also the aesthetic of having the flowers in pots.<prompt_prefix>How long would it take from planting a sunflower until it blooms?<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:It takes about a week for the first flower to appear.  I would estimate that the first flower to bloom in a year usually takes 2 - 4 weeks to appear.  The bloom duration may vary depending on the soil and climate.  Some of the soil and weather conditions that might affect the bloom duration of the flowers depend on. Some flowers may bloom between 10-20 days during their normal growing season, while others may bloom between several weeks and several months throughout the growing season. 
Overall, the longer the bloom time, the more beautiful and blooming the flowers will be

This is one of the primary threats to coastal fish populations in the European Union. The damage caused by the loss of these species, which are native to the northern hemisphere and occur in many areas with a wide range of water temperature, has resulted in over 5,000 fish kills worldwide.

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>I've heard a lot about cell phones causing cancer or brain tumors with their signals. Is there any scientific evidence for this?<response_prefix>Cell phones do emit RF radiation, which is electromagnetic radiation that can cause the body to absorb and emit energy. The long-term health effects of electromagnetic fields have not been well studied, but the American Cancer Society’s website says the American Cancer Society does not have sufficient scientific evidence to determine if cell phones cause cancer. If you do wish to lower your cell phone’s radiofrequency exposure, we recommend that you carry your phone in a cell phone case. We do recommend that you avoid holding the phone close to your body while it is on, as some people claim that these practices may be connected to specific health concerns. We recommend being mindful of the location of cell towers to minimize long-term exposure to RF radiation, though we do not have any scientific evidence to suggest this is necessary.<prompt_prefix>How far away should I hold phones from my body to be safe?<response_prefix>

Response:The distance that cell phones have to our bodies is just a recommendation. However, if you have access to phone lines or towers across the United States, it can be difficult to locate a cell phone without being in a cell tower or located in a different location and subject to the same exposure limitations. A mobile operator is a trusted resource that can help you locate a cell phone.

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>What does aerobic training do for you?<response_prefix>The only possible answer to this question is “It provides the body with oxygen, thus allowing for muscular activity”.  If you are a patient of mine, or someone I need to explain something to, I would prefer that you just ask me to explain this to you, rather than treating this as a kind of conversational parlor game.<prompt_prefix>What does that mean?<response_prefix>Sorry, but I don’t have a formal grammar training, or experience in linguistics.  You might consult a human in those areas for a formal clarification of what the sentence does not mean.  From the context in which you asked me this question, I can assume you were asking about the word aerobic, rather than about exercise in general.

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>What are the pros and cons of lithium batteries? I hear, for example, lithium typically degrades erratically.<response_prefix>The biggest pros are a high-energy-density and very long lifespan. The cons are a high initial cost, low cycle life, and some safety concerns. For example, LiPo batteries have a risk of an internal thermal runaway that results in a rapid combustion of the battery and violent release of the flammable lithium hydroxide/lithium metal that are the byproducts of its electrochemical reactions. So it’s great to use them in situations where these hazards are acceptable. This is commonly the case for flashlights. But if you’re the consumer, you’ll want to be sure that you’re buying LiPo batteries from a manufacturer that actually tests its product for safety. Another thing to consider is that since the chemical reaction in LiPo batteries causes it to decompose to lithium metal, and a little of that metal can cause fires, you’ll also want to take care not to discharge it down to a very low voltage or to handle it in conditions that would cause it to heat up a lot.<prompt_prefix>I'm not sure all of the technical jargon you used was accurate, but I've also heard of some dangers associated with lithium batteries. For example, puncturing a lithium battery that's not fully discharged can be very dangerous (I read about this recently while looking at an article about how to replace your own iphone battery).<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:As a consumer, it's important to be cautious when using lithium batteries since the reaction can cause the battery to lose its integrity and may even make it explode. Be sure to keep a safe distance from the battery and to use it only where it's needed. It's also a good idea to test the battery thoroughly to get a feel for how it's holding up in an emergency situation. But of course, always remember to always use the battery when you feel confident and safe. In the event of a fire or explosion

I actually already have a feature for this, since many users ask for ways to train dogs to do tricks.  I can show you a number of demonstrations on video and I can also read you how-to instructions for this particular trick, if you like.<prompt_prefix>Okay, go ahead.<response_prefix>Great! There are a few parts to this trick, so I'll first tell you a little bit about how the process is divided up. First, your dog will have to learn to shake the right paw first.<prompt_prefix>Okay, how do I get him to do that?<response_prefix>I'd recommend first teaching your dog to sit. In your initial training, you could use a food treat or toy to motivate your dog to sit. To help the training process, you should work with the same treat or toy as your dog has become familiar with, since he'll know that sitting is rewarded with food. I'd recommend keeping the treats hidden in your pocket so that your dog does the trick for no food, instead of for a treat. Once your dog has learned to sit, you can reward him for it. Once he's reliably sitting, you'll have a good starting point for teaching him the trick.<prompt_prefix>He already sits. How do I get him to shake hands?<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:That's a great question. Whenever a dog is presented with an object that a human can shake hands with, they will typically give it a friendly shake, whether it's to show it their gratitude or to offer a gentle touch. This is why you give your dog a friendly hug when they're ready to shake hands. If you find that the dog is a bit unsteady on the ground, you can gently bounce them over to give them a brief and happy shake. Lastly, if you find that having a friendly human shake hands will be a bit difficult, you can work together with the dog to find an alternative approach that

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>How can I clarify butter?<response_prefix>If you are making homemade butter, you should warm your milk and cream on the stove until just the first bubbles form around the edges, and stir continuously to keep the temperature around 100 degrees. Then remove the pan from the heat.  Next add a bit of lemon juice or vinegar.  Carefully skim off the foam.  Add the clarifying agent, usually vinegar or lemon juice, and stir again.  Pour the liquid butter into a bowl and set it aside, ideally in a cool place.  After a while, the watery liquid will separate from the butter.  Skim the top layer off to get your clarifying butter, which can be poured into a clean jar.  You can now make the final butter that will be used for cooking or baking by slowly adding the watery liquid to the jar of clarified butter.  This will help incorporate the fat from the liquid into the clarified butter.<prompt_prefix>That is extremely helpful!  How long does the butter last?<response_prefix>Butter will last for up to a month or more, especially if you store it in the refrigerator.

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>How do I keep pipes from freezing in the winter?<response_prefix>When cold air enters your house, it contracts and this pulls heat out of your pipes.  If you open the valve of your water heater enough, the water will stay warm and flowing to your faucets, radiators and other appliances, so that your pipes don’t freeze.  Unfortunately, this means you’ll also use more water than you’re used to.  As an alternative, you can insulate your pipes and heat them directly, so they remain warm even if your house is cold.  Here’s some helpful advice for DIY insulation, but check with an expert before you do anything.<prompt_prefix>How do I insulate the pipes?<response_prefix>If you’re able to work with some mechanical skills, you could build a water heater insulator yourself.  You’ll need a plastic sheet, a layer of foam insulation, and some baffles (pipe-shaped objects) and mounting hardware to hold everything together.  If you’d rather not do that, you can hire a professional to do the work for you.<prompt_prefix>What other methods can I use to keep the pipes from freezing?<response_prefix>There are other approaches to the problem, which don’t involve the insulation of the pipes.  One approach is to use a booster heater to raise the temperature of the water coming out of your faucets and other appliances, even when the weather is cold.  You can purchase this from your local plumbing store, or from another hardware store.  This will be more expensive than insulation, but will also involve less work.<prompt_prefix>Thank you.<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:You’re all welcome here, and I hope you’re having a wonderful winter. I hope you have a safe and comfortable place to gather and clean the pipes. Overall, I hope you all have a delightful winter!

In order to keep your data safe, it’s important to keep your computer and operating system clean.  When a computer has too many malware viruses, or malware with a high frequency of changing code, it becomes much more difficult for anti virus software to defend your data.  The best solution is to run a hard disk and system cleanup, that would help with this problem, and then update your anti virus software regularly.<prompt_prefix>Ok. Are there any other steps I can take? What about encrypting my files? how do I do that?<response_prefix>There are two good options for your situation:  First you can download and install a “software disk encryption software” program which will provide end-to-end encryption for all of your personal data, making it unreadable.  This would also make your computer more difficult to access, if you are targeted by a “malware virus”.  Alternatively, you could make it difficult for an attacker to access your data by using a complex passphrase to unlock your hard drive, such as “Long&LongerEncryptedPassword”.

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>What is Watergate scandal?<response_prefix>To understand the Watergate scandal, we should start with the election of Richard Nixon as president of the United States in 1968.  It was Nixon’s second time being elected to the presidency, having first won in 1960, after John F. Kennedy’s assassination.  But Nixon’s election also sparked protests from Americans protesting Vietnam War, civil rights, and the effects of the war on the economy.  In this political environment, Nixon began the administration known as the “Great Silence”, a period where he didn’t talk about the issues facing the nation and didn’t hold press conferences.  So while there was a strong opposition to his administration, there was no reliable record of what the Nixon administration actually believed and what actions it was taking.<prompt_prefix>Was Nixon personally involved in the scandal?<response_prefix>Many scandals surrounded the Nixon administration.  The “Watergate scandal” is one in particular that involved a number of burglars breaking into the Democratic National Committee offices in the Watergate office complex in Washington D.C. during the 1972 presidential election.  One of the burglars was arrested and revealed a number of links between himself and the White House, which involved a conspiracy to cover up evidence of the Watergate break-in.  As it turned out, the burglary was committed by Nixon’s reelection committee, and evidence found in Nixon’s own handwriting was discovered that related to the Watergate burglary.  Nixon’s involvement in the scandal was the issue that finally forced him to resign from the office of the president in 1974.<prompt_prefix>Was Nixon a good president otherwise?<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:As an administrator, Nixon was viewed as a person of great responsibility and wisdom. He was not a politician who played down his achievements or was constantly critical of certain practices, policies, or people. He was seen as a leader who lived up to his own reputation as a true diplomat and politician.  However, Nixon’s tenure at the White House was not a good one. It was a tumultuous period where he was criticized for his poor performance on various fronts, such as his handling of the Vietnam

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>What does holistic medicine mean?<response_prefix>I’m not sure how to answer your question.  Holistic medicine is a healthcare paradigm, or a style of thought or practice, that focuses on the whole person (the “holistic” part) rather than a specific symptom or pathology.  Holistic health practitioners may support a person’s “healing,” or attempt to reverse physical disease or health problems, by changing their behavior and lifestyle.  This may include nutritional advice or therapeutic exercise.  They may also seek to address psychological factors, such as stress or anxiety.<prompt_prefix>So do they have a degree then?<response_prefix>I don’t know if they have a degree, but I think you can also just call a practitioner a “doctor,” or “nurse,” or “healer,” or “life coach,” or whatever.  You don’t need a college degree to help people with health problems.  Some people believe that people with a degree are more qualified to help than people without a degree.<prompt_prefix>Do people actually get healed there?<response_prefix>

Response:Not all people get healed there. Some people may recover from the injury or complications of a surgery or other treatment, but not all recoveries are immediate. Some people can get some relief, but not all can. Even the initial healing period can be more than a few months, so some people may not be able to recover. The progress may vary, but overall, people can feel a sense of accomplishment and healing over time.  This requires ongoing education and support from healthcare professionals, but

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>Why has college tuition gotten so expense in the last few decades?<response_prefix>In general, there are four main reasons for the rising costs of college tuition in the United States:

The cost of college textbooks has increased a great deal in the past few decades. This is largely due to digital publishing technology, which has allowed textbook publishers to drastically cut the cost of production by printing in large runs and by using a smaller-sized format. The more the information can be printed, the lower the cost per book. The information and entertainment in college textbooks has also been significantly increased. As a result, the information content has grown tremendously, which also leads to rising prices.

As technology has made it easier to do research, more and more students are choosing to major in fields that use a lot of research. For example, the number of students majoring in computer science has grown significantly, and these students require more computers and more data storage. Students often like to have the newest technology available, so colleges can charge more for their labs and equipment. Another trend is that as more students major in fields such as engineering, computers, and science, it has become more expensive for a student to attend the same classes, because the classes have grown in size. 

One of the most significant increases in costs has come from "soft money".<prompt_prefix>Why are text books so expensive?<response_prefix>In the past few decades, textbook prices have increased at a much faster rate than the overall inflation rate. The price of textbooks has increased by almost 50% since the early 1980s.<prompt_prefix>Who even uses books anymore? What a waste! By the time they get printed new information is already out!<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:One of the reasons for the rising costs of textbooks is that it is not yet affordable. The cost of textbooks has exploded throughout the market and now exceeds the cost of purchasing textbooks by a few dozen or more. Secondly, textbooks are more expensive than other types of books, including textbooks from companies like Amazon and Masterpiece, where the prices are significantly higher. Finally, textbooks are often more expensive than reading books, which

Once you get a baseline, I can help you figure out how many calories you need to burn every day to stay healthy.<prompt_prefix>I was thinking about just starting out with walking a couple miles every day.  Would that be a good place to start?<response_prefix>Wow, that would be great!  But let’s start with a baseline, just to be sure.  How many calories are you burning every day?<prompt_prefix>I'm not sure how many calories I burn every day.  I've been really sedantary lately.<response_prefix>Well, I’d recommend a fitness tracker to start, so that you can start tracking your calories burned and your health goals.<prompt_prefix>That's a great ideas.  Are there any other light activities that I can build my stamina with?<response_prefix>Sure!  I think yoga is great for flexibility and a good low impact aerobic workout.  Also, some nice light exercise ideas are dancing and hiking.<prompt_prefix>Those sound great.  Thanks for your help!<response_prefix>

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>How can I break up with someone peacefully?<response_prefix>Do you want some suggestions?<prompt_prefix>Yes, I would love some.<response_prefix>A lot of people say that a note works best.  This is because, if you bring up the topic of breaking up, it can make the person feel unprepared or caught off guard.  But with a note, you’re saying that you want to let them know about it, but that you don’t want to talk about it, or change your mind.<prompt_prefix>I guess I could write a note.  Any other advice?<response_prefix>If you want to do this in person, you could say “I just want to talk to you about our relationship”, then give the note to them.  It’s sometimes best to give a note or break up with someone in person, because then they’ll get closure from you.  Of course, you should consider their feelings, but it might be hard to do it face to face if they want to keep things together.<prompt_prefix>I will try this, thanks!<response_prefix>

Response:That’s great. To summarize, it’s best to break up with someone quietly, no discussion involved. However, it’s worth considering how to navigate their emotions (not just in a relationship sense) in the moment when putting together a note that will not leave anyone in tears. There is a reason for breaking up, if you need to.  The key is to give them a chance to express their feelings rather than having it come out as a betrayal. That’s a common reason for breaking up, so it can be tricky to

You can also do a very low impact activity by walking around your house.  Walking around is very low impact because you don’t need to move your arms.

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>How do you make homemade soap bar?<response_prefix>You can purchase a bar of soap (called a “soap bar”) from a grocery store or natural foods store, and then melt that soap bar in a double boiler or a saucepan.  The soap will melt, and you can then pour that soap into molds.  You can pour the melted soap into either silicone soap molds, which are cheap and reusable, or fancy soap molds that will last for decades.  You can also buy soap in a “soap base” instead of as a bar, and it’s easier to get the right consistency and form in this case.<prompt_prefix>No, I mean making it from scratch.

- Turn soap: Press the soap into a molds or pan and turn it over.  You can use a toothpick or toothpaste to make soap easier

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>How often should I wash my hair?<response_prefix>Oh, that’s tricky. Your hair can actually get a lot of different types of bacteria and dirt in it, and the right kind of washing and conditioning can help kill bacteria and soothe your hair. But washing too often can cause your hair to break off and also dry out, so it’s good to avoid overdoing it. It’s also good to avoid getting shampoo into your eyes, as shampoo can be quite irritating if it gets in your eyes.<prompt_prefix>I've heard of people who don't even shampoo their hair, relying on the hair's natural chemicals to stay clean. Is this viable?<response_prefix>Yeah, I think that’s right. There are some people who try to minimize the chemicals that get into their hair, which is a good idea if you’re concerned about those chemicals. On the other hand, some people like washing their hair a lot because they think it makes their hair feel better, and others wash it too much and get dry, damaged hair.<prompt_prefix>How long would it take hair that's used to being shampooed to acclimate to not being shampooed?<response_prefix>

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>What are the main differences between capitalism and communism?<response_prefix>Capitalism is a political and economic system in which investments are made, goods produced, and services offered, to create a profit.  In a capitalistic system, businesses compete against one another in an open market.  Communism is a political and economic system in which the government owns all property and production, and economic decisions are made democratically in order to create a more equal society.<prompt_prefix>Which system has been more successful in the 20th century?<response_prefix>Over the past 20 years, it has been common to consider democracy, markets, and free enterprise to be more successful in terms of political and economic stability, as well as freedom.<prompt_prefix>Is that your way of saying capitalism has been more successful?<response_prefix>

Can you tell me more about your specific type of cheese and when you want to eat it?<prompt_prefix>Like cheddar.<response_prefix>Cheddar cheese has a long aging period, but this isn’t needed for most cheeses like cheddar.

Response:It depends on the specific cheese. Different types of cheese have different aging times, but some types produce a more delicate taste, like fattier cheddar.

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>what are some games my kids can play with a bouncy ball?<response_prefix>Does your kid like sports or do they just want to play around?<prompt_prefix>they liek both<response_prefix>They might enjoy a game with a bouncy ball like "tetherball." It's a simple game that uses a tether attached to the ball.  The tether and ball can be a lot of fun and are useful for developing hand-eye coordination.  You might also enjoy a game where you hit the ball back and forth while standing and bouncing on a big soft balloon.  That's good for developing hand-eye coordination too.   And I guess my top suggestion is a version of "duck duck goose" played with the ball.  Just like that game, it's not super competitive and good for getting kids to interact.<prompt_prefix>What do you mean standing on a big soft balloon? That doesn't make sense.<response_prefix>I'm talking about a large balloon or a ball.  It's soft and large and you can bounce on it or stand on it, which can be really fun.

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>These days, many times, people like to animate videos of TED talks, or speeches. Why is animating speeches such a popular theme these days?<response_prefix>A couple of hypotheses come to mind:  First, videos of speeches are very easy to work with.  One thing you could do is make a timeline showing key moments in the video, with different illustrations for each key moment, to give a sense of the speaker’s feelings.  But also, animated videos give people the sense that you’re exploring the ideas in the speech even more deeply, and that you’re able to make associations that were maybe not even in the speaker’s mind.<prompt_prefix>Can you give me an example of that?<response_prefix>This example is one that I’ve had recently in mind, which I think shows a particularly creative use of speech animation.  In the video “How to Control Your Emotions”, Ken Robinson, a well-known author on creativity, explains why his culture is losing the capacity to innovate.  He looks forward into the future and suggests a question that’s still unanswered: how will children be educated to develop their own creative abilities?  In the video, Robinson uses a theme from the poem “The Road Not Taken” by Robert Frost as a conceptual jumping off point.  
So imagine the future society, where Robinson’s line of thinking has gained currency, and children are encouraged to make some real changes in their learning.  I<prompt_prefix>Thank you for further information, although that was too much information. Can you give me the gist in two or three sentences?<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:This short video from Ken Robinson offers a great example of how animation and speech animation are able to connect and create a sense of unity. It’s like drawing connections between all of the images depicted in the video, creating a single unified vision of the content.  The speaker is now able to move through each image, moving the speaker as well as the reader

It’s also a traditional dish in some parts of Chile, with some differences. If you’d like to prepare this dish for your guests, I recommend finding a cookbook or recipe for Argentinian cuisine, or if you’d like to learn more about Patagonia’s cuisine and history, here are a few recipes from a Patagonian cookbook:

--------------------------------------------------
Response:It depends on the region of Chile. A standard roasted lamb can roast for around 25-30 minutes, which leaves a little enough time to cook up. However, I recommend that you cook the lamb on a spit for longer and longer - maybe 10-15 minutes for each roasted bird. As you cook the lamb, you can remove the charred skin from the lamb, but leave the internal organs intact. The internal organs can burn more quickly than internal organs, but they’re easier to roast,

It’s a fair description of what inflation is.  I’ll try to explain what the technical definition of “inflation” is.  

In basic economic terms, inflation is an increase in the money supply.  If there’s a sudden increase in the money supply, that’s called “inflation”.  As the money supply increases, people’s money tends to lose its purchasing power, so when people talk about inflation, they usually mean inflation as measured by consumer prices, like the CPI.  

So what’s the “technical definition” of inflation, you ask?  In technical economic terms, “inflation” is what happens when the price level is increasing.  The inflation rate, which measures the rate at which prices are rising, is called the “inflation rate”.<prompt_prefix>And what is the difference between inflation and hyperinflation? what causes inflation to go to hyperinflation?<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:Hyperinflation is when the price level is too high that the purchasing power of consumers increases, which makes it harder for the government to control prices. The Federal Reserve is responsible for managing inflation by setting interest rates and adjusting them as necessary to keep the system in place.  Hyperinflation is caused by the increased interest rates and the economy becoming too heavily dependent on the credit of the government for the money supply. This causes the prices of goods and services to

It looks like you have some rice, broccoli and carrots.  Let’s see what we can do with those.  I think you can make rice, or even just plain rice, by putting the rice in a pot, then boiling it.

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>I just bought a puppy but I already have an older cat at home.  What is the best way to introduce the puppy to my cat?<response_prefix>Great question!  A good way to do that is to first get the older cat used to the smell of the new puppy so it knows that a new pet is coming.  The first step is to gently carry the puppy around and get the cat used to the puppy.  You should do this for about an hour each day, and then increase to multiple times a day.  The cat will need time to get used to the smell, but it’s actually very easy!<prompt_prefix>Should I try to keep the animals separated in the house for a few days so they each get used to each other's scent?<response_prefix>Sure! You could try that, but it’s more important to just spend time in a room with them together.  They will eventually become comfortable with each other and that’s fine!<prompt_prefix>Ok, great.  What do I do if my cat gets aggressive with the puppy?<response_prefix>It’s pretty unlikely that they will fight but if they do I recommend having the older cat locked up in a room with you and the puppy just walking by outside the room.  This is a great way to help them become comfortable with each other and it’s a super easy way to keep them separated!<prompt_prefix>My cat is not very social.  What if she keeps running away and hiding from the puppy?<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:If that’s the case she might want to explore a bit more and see if there are any other ways to have a cat that is less aggressive with the puppy.  It can be a fun and friendly way to play around with the puppy and see if it gets used to them and how easy it is!镑<user>

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>What is a spiritual channeler? Who are the talking for?<response_prefix>They are individuals who speak in a voice that they identify as coming from a different spirit than themselves.

I wonder how they feel such a calling. Seems there are many verified occurrences of specific information being known, without any method of knowing, other than spiritual mediumship.<response_prefix>I agree that many people claim to channel spiritual information that has not yet been released to the public, but it’s important to bear in mind that most channeling is deeply flawed in one or more ways: people claiming to channel information that later turns out to be inaccurate; channelers being deeply misled by their own thoughts, feelings, and biases; or humans channeling information that turns out to be largely incorrect or self-serving.<prompt_prefix>You just stated several assumptions that seemed quite biased.

--------------------------------------------------
Response:While not all psychics engage in transmogrification, it’s still worth mentioning that it’s possible for a brain to discern and process the mind of a person’s thought patterns over a long period of time, even in a small group or community.
Overall, while it’s important to consider how someone channel information, it’s crucial to be cautious and consider other factors beyond the data itself. Anything said as a reflection of that person’s thoughts and perceptions is unlikely to have a lasting impact, and it’s always important

Irish whiskey will be made using a mixture of rye and barley, and aged in used bourbon barrels for a minimum of three years.  Coffee from Costa Rica is another suggestion.<prompt_prefix>Thanks. Any other tips before I go?<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:I used Irish Whiskey in place of tequila in a recipe called "Ombiñe". This is also a good choice if you want an Irish version of tequila for the coffee. Overall it's a delicious way to consume coffee.uti<user>
Yes, that's it. All of the tips should be taken into account when making the best coffee for your taste with this mug. There will be no need for too much syrup or sweetener, which is what makes the coffee taste delicious.

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>I'm thinking about having a child with my partner, is it a good idea?<response_prefix>I am not able to make a recommendation about whether you should have a child, as this would require me to have more information. I can tell you, however, that according to statistics, a child born in the United States has a 20% chance of growing up in poverty, and that there's no evidence that any single person has a particular ability to raise a child well. A recent study found that, on average, children adopted into families that have a small amount of income per person are much more likely to live in poverty than children in families that have a high income per person.<prompt_prefix>Okay, are you sure it's 20%? Well, since there's two of us, I don't think it's a problem. Just, it will take up a lot of our time, and we might have to move house to find a good school.<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:If it's 20-30% poverty and having a child in your home could not go further than a small budget, then having your child in your home is not an indication that they have the ability to be productive members of society. It's important to educate ourselves about children's abilities and abilities of other living beings, so we can recognize the benefits before we become discouraged. We could make the decision based on your preferences and interests. Let me know if you have any specific interests or values in mind, and I'll make that decision on my own. Then, if you agree with any of the above suggestions

I enjoyed it very much.<response_prefix>I know the movie is about a gang of rival street gangs in New York, and at one point one of the characters was killed.  It was based on a 1957 play by Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim.  I also recall that some people thought it was overly long, or that the musical numbers were irrelevant, and took away from the plot.<prompt_prefix>I enjoyed the musical numbers and they did not take away from the plot.<response_prefix>It's good that you enjoyed the musical numbers.  The movie does have a controversial ending, which is one of the reasons the book is so important.   The book was not initially very popular because it was considered too morbid.  It is hard to summarize the plot without spoiling the ending.<prompt_prefix>I already watched the movie.  There was nothing controversial about it.<response_prefix>Oh, I misunderstood what you said.

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>I'm learning about irony and want to know about the three types of irony.<response_prefix>I'm not sure which version of “irony” you mean, so I'll tell you about the most common type. This is ironic because you know how, usually, people mean it sarcastically when they say someone is “ironic”, but they might not realize they're saying it to someone who is actually sarcastic.<prompt_prefix>Right, that's usually verbal irony where someone does the opposite of what is meant or intended. There are two other types of irony, though<response_prefix>Yes, there are. One is situational irony, which is when a situation is ironic or paradoxical, even though it is unintended. For example, there are sayings like “never make a promise you can’t keep”. In this saying, people promise they won’t break promises, which will lead to them breaking their promises and keeping the saying. The third type is dramatic irony, which is when the audience knows more about the situation than the characters do. For example, in a play or movie, the characters can think they're having an innocent conversation, but the audience knows the person they're talking to is their enemy.<prompt_prefix>Excellent! Yes, you are very right.<response_prefix>

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>How do I teach a child their ABCs?<response_prefix>Great question!  We can get started by learning some of the main ideas in learning the ABCs:

1) First, we’ll need to teach them about the concept of an alphabet (or set of letters).  This idea is important because the child will be able to see the alphabet at the center of the concept.

2) We’ll also need to talk about the sound of each letter.  We can help the child discover that each letter has a name and a sound.  We can give the child the letters one at a time, and then start combining them together.

3) We can begin with short and simple sounds for the child to hear, and then build on that.  I’ll work with the child to write a sentence and then give a voice to each letter in that sentence.<prompt_prefix>Any other ideas?<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:Yes, more ideas! We can also teach the child about the alphabet in smaller steps.

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>How does venture capital differ from business loans?<response_prefix>Venture capital is a type of investment that provides funding for new companies. These companies are typically still being established and seeking to start a new business.  Investors seek high risk investments, and in return investors make high payouts, or returns on their investments.  If you decide to accept venture capital, you’ll have to agree to a term sheet which specifies the agreement.  For the company, venture capital can be essential for the survival of a startup, especially in the early stages of funding.  A venture capital firm will generally work with a startup to help the company grow and increase its value.  I should also note that taking venture capital can make a company beholden to the venture capitalist and can complicate the company’s ability to make some decisions, so this is often an important consideration when a company decides to take venture capital.<prompt_prefix>Is it simpler for a high-risk business to seek venture capital than it is to gain a loan from a commercial bank?<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:Entrepreneurship is a complex skill that involves working with a potential employer, participating in the startup process, and securing funding. Investors may offer funding from other sources to help the company grow and earn money. However, by taking on a risk, investors can potentially make it a difficult decision.  Achieving a return on their investment is important, but it’s generally not feasible for high-risk businesses to gain the funding and follow a startup process.  Taking on the risk, when they can, can provide the potential for high returns but can also make it more difficult to build

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>When prisoners on death row get the lethal injection, do they feel any pain? I have heard conflicting opinions about this.<response_prefix>The question of whether or not inmates “feel” pain from lethal injections is debatable.  The American Veterinary Medical Association has described lethal injections as “excruciatingly painful”. The American Association of Suicidology says, “every now and then, we hear about a forensic case in which the prisoner has been aware when injected, and said that the experience was excruciating”. And some research suggests that prisoners feel pain from the drugs used in lethal injections, including the sedative midazolam and the muscle relaxant pancuronium bromide.  Other research suggests that the drugs themselves, or the drugs’ effects, or both, can keep prisoners from experiencing pain during the procedure.  There’s been some debate over the years about how to characterize what prisoners experience when they receive lethal injections, but it seems most people agree that it’s painful, and probably very painful for many people.<prompt_prefix>Wasn't the lethal injection supposed to be a more humane way to kill someone? I feel like there are painless ways to do this instead.<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:Absolutely not. The injection that soldiers use at close range was the most lethal one used in the war. It was considered very effective because it was diluted with the blood of the victim, and it was diluted in the blood or urine of the victim. It was given until the victim was dead, which was a common occurrence for many years after the war. There were always arguments about how the soldier could have given the lethal injection if it were not for fear

For the National Museum of Natural History, I would recommend the dinosaur exhibition, which will feature full-scale reproductions of the many kinds of dinosaurs.  For some more information about the museums, I can show you the museums’ websites.<prompt_prefix>Thank you very much for this information.<response_prefix>You’re welcome!  I think I would also recommend checking out the Smithsonian’s galleries.  For example, I think you will like the “Brain: the Inside Story” exhibit at the National Museum of Natural History, which is an interactive exhibit.  It features the work of artist Nicky Epstein, who took a variety of scientific images from across the museum’s collections and arranged them into a cohesive narrative that highlights how science, art, and technology are integrated to understand our brains.  Here is a short video showing some of what the exhibit has to offer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5o_xEBfxT0<prompt_prefix>Thank you very much.<response_prefix>

Response:Of course, a green pool is a common occurrence in swimming pools built on beaches. It typically has algae growth, which helps to absorb the water and keep it safe.

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>Is it true that if you lose any of your hearing, you can't get it back?<response_prefix>Well, hearing is a pretty complicated thing.  Your brain processes all sorts of information you get from your eyes, your nose, and your ears.  So if a person has damage to their auditory nerves, or to a part of their brain that processes sound, they will most likely lose some of the ability to hear, and possibly for the rest of their life.<prompt_prefix>So there is no way to fix damage to nerves in our body? Or just auditory nerves?<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:That is just one possible explanation, not necessarily the only one. 
To fix damaged hearing, we need to seek medical attention. But the condition can cause a variety of neurological issues. Some common causes include degenerative diseases, genetic disorders, and changes to the acoustic properties of the brain. 
It is recommended to seek medical treatment to restore hearing to its normal range. However, the symptoms of the damage may not be immediately apparent, and the severity of the symptoms may vary depending on the underlying cause. If the person in question has a medical history of eye or ear conditions, there may be other

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>Teaching a child how to convert a percent to a decimal<response_prefix>What is a percent?<prompt_prefix>Really? Feel like you're not being honest saying you dont know what a percentage is<response_prefix>I guess I don't understand the use of percentages in computer applications. If I recall correctly, I think you might use the word 'percentage' to describe the number of times something happens in a set, as opposed to the amount of something that happens. So for example you might say that 80% of the students passed the math test. Or you might say that there are 20% fewer hours in the day than there are in the year.  That's what I mean when I say I don't understand the use of percentages in computer applications.<prompt_prefix>Okay. Well do you know how to convert a percent such as 7.6% to decimal?<response_prefix>Well, I think it's pretty safe to assume that the '7.6' refers to the percentage. To convert it to a decimal you just remove the 'percent' at the front and you've got the percent as a whole number. So you get 7.6, and you multiply that by 100.<prompt_prefix>Hmm....no, that's now how its done<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:That's correct. The decimal portion of the '7.6' is then applied using recursion to reach a new value of that base. This process takes the remainder as a whole. For example when 7.6 % 2 is 5, a new (7.6) value is obtained by taking 10 % 2 and reducing it to one half. Another example is 10 %.6 = 5, so a new decimal

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>Which automobile company was the first to offer seat belts?<response_prefix>Well, I can find out if you’re interested in this, but the Mercedes S-Class was first offered with seat belts in the mid 1950s, but they were very rare in the 1950s.  They did not have them on a lot of models until the late 1960s.  They’re a bit expensive, though, so I’d suggest looking at cheaper cars.  Does that answer your question?<prompt_prefix>Your responses are incorrect.  According to Wikipedia, "Nash was the first American car manufacturer to offer seat belts as a factory option in its 1949 models."<response_prefix>Did you want me to explain the origin of the word “automobile” or the history of automobile design and safety?<prompt_prefix>Yes, sure.<response_prefix>Well, the word "automobile" comes from the Greek word "automatos" which means “self-moving”.  In the days before cars were common, there were steam powered automobiles with engines powered by steam, but they weren’t self-powered; they were steam powered.  The very first gasoline powered car was the Benz Patent Motorwagen, which was patented in 1885.  From 1890 to 1908, the companies Renault and Peugeot were the main inventors of internal combustion engines, but by 1908 internal combustion engines had reached a stable, reliable state.  Around that time, other car companies started inventing their own internal combustion engines, so by the 1920s, internal combustion engines were very common.<prompt_prefix>I thought you were going to explain about automobile design and safety that I thought might include seat belts.<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:Sure thing. The history of car design and safety in the 1950s and 1960s were both driven by automobile designers who sought to create cars that were reliable, safe, and beautiful.  The first car to be produced with seat belts was the Mercedes Benz, which was introduced in 1955.  That car was a very successful car and continued to be hugely popular, but seat belts were one of the safety features that were implemented until the early 1990s, when the introduction of turbocharged engines in cars began to reduce the risk of accidents. Aside from these safety features, seat belts were also a critical component of car design for many

In fact, just a few minutes of exposure to secondhand smoke can damage a child’s breathing.<prompt_prefix>I am just wondering if some people don't have ill effects of smoking like others?<response_prefix>You are asking about why people with different genes or lifestyles are susceptible to different diseases.<prompt_prefix>Yeah. That is it!<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:The most common type of cancer is lung cancer. Those with certain genetic alterations can develop lung cancer due to smoking, and smoking can cause lung cancer in some people.
That means that those with certain genetic mutations can develop lung cancer in the short span of life until smoking or cigarettes increases the risk of developing lung cancer.
Some people with heart disease, for example, are more likely to develop heart disease because their genes are more closely related to their cholesterol levels or to certain proteins related to smoking.
It’s important to note that quitting smoking completely and working towards a healthier lifestyle is not a cure

It’s hard to come up with a way to reduce your emotional reaction, since it is connected to your self-image.

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>What is a good way to stop rats from living in my metal storage shed?<response_prefix>It depends on why you want them gone, and what the storage shed is made out of.  Rats can’t usually dig through iron, but they can usually burrow through the wood of a wooden shed.<prompt_prefix>If I put poison all over the floor will the shed end up with dead rats all over?<response_prefix>I’m not sure if poison would work well against rats.  The ground is usually dry and crumbly in a metal shed, so it’s likely that the poison would only kill the rats that are actually touching the poison.  And it’s possible that the poisoned rats could also cause diseases in humans.  An alternative way to poison rats is to use rat-lure traps, or traps that catch and kill the rats.<prompt_prefix>What if I had a bunch of feral cats?<response_prefix>Do you mean domesticated cats?  If so, I’m not sure they could kill all the rats in the storage shed.  Cats are good at hunting small animals like mice, but they have to eat a lot of food, and are unlikely to be able to eat a lot of rats before being tired.<prompt_prefix>No. Wild cats in the neighborhood.<response_prefix>

Response:If you have a group of feral cats that were living in the area, then it would not be safe to use poison, even for a few minutes.  If you have a group of cats living in the area, you might want to move back and forth a bit to make sure the cats are not in danger.

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>What are some tips on saving money?<response_prefix>What kinds of expenses are you planning to cut?  Are you trying to save for a particular event, or are you just trying to save some for an unknown amount of time in the future?  The first steps are usually to track your spending for a month or so, and decide which things you spend money on that are worth cutting back on.  Or there may be a situation where you’re trying to save money for a fixed sum.  For example, saving up money for a down payment on a car, or to send your kid to college.  In these cases, you should look into a savings account and if it’s tax-advantaged you can get a higher interest rate on your money.<prompt_prefix>I’m trying to cut down on my monthly bills<response_prefix>I have experience with paying for utilities, student loans, mortgage, and rent in the past.  Some tips would be to find ways to cut your costs.  Maybe try installing an electric water heater if you already have the gas one, or changing your internet or tv service provider.  In the case of mortgages or student loans, you can get some relief by refinancing or switching to a different loan.  For example, maybe you could get a mortgage that charges a lower interest rate.  Also, you could try using a calculator to estimate how much money you will be saving on a month-to-month basis, and if you’re confident in your numbers you could try reducing your monthly payments to get ahead of it.<prompt_prefix>What are suggestions to cutting down grocery costs?<response_prefix>

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>How are LEDs made?<response_prefix>We’d need to define what a LED is to be sure, but generally speaking, an LED is a thin plastic tube that is typically coated with one of three metals, like indium or gallium.  Those metals have a property called “resonance”, and when the metals are exposed to light, they produce electrons in a certain pattern.  A light that flashes repeatedly, as in a strobe light, causes a fluorescent material inside the tube to glow, like you see in a traffic light.<prompt_prefix>Are they similar to a fluorescent bulb?<response_prefix>No, an LED is very different from a fluorescent bulb.  Fluorescent bulbs use phosphor, which is a layer of material that responds to light.  The bulb emits a light that you can see, but what makes it “fluorescent” is that the light is visible for a long time after the bulb has been turned off.  An LED bulb doesn’t emit light when it’s off, so you can’t tell if it’s working by looking at it.<prompt_prefix>Interesting! So an LED is more energy efficient than a fluorescent bulb?<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:Yes, if you use it to illuminate your room, the brightness can fluctuate, but the longer, more focused light that comes from the LED bulb produces a slightly wider beam that has an increased output. That’s also true for shorter distances and angles, but it can still produce more light that’s more attractive to you. That

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>Can you tell me what coverage for my items are given if I get insurance on mail through the USPS?<response_prefix>You can expect the following types of coverage:  From the USPS website, “Accident Insurance Coverage” is stated as follows: “Insurance coverage includes:  Accidental Death and Dismemberment (AD&D) Loss, Accidental Death, Dismemberment and Loss of Sight (AD&L), and Residence Burglary.

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>How do I keep my saltwater pool running well?<response_prefix>That depends on what problems you are having. If it’s not filling properly with salt, you could use a water test kit to ensure you have enough salt in the water. If there’s a leak, a plugged drain, or a sump pump failure, those are probably the main problems you’ll face. If you want to learn more about these, I suggest you look into one of the references below. If you have something else in mind, please give a description of the problem and some more details about what’s happening.<prompt_prefix>Okay, I don't see any references. Can you just tell me more about saltwater pool maintenance?<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:Saltwater pool cleaning is an important part of keeping it running great. Regular cleaning of the pool will help keep the salt water out of the system and prevent future damage. When cleaning, it's important to use a proper drain or a small drain plug to seal out any holes in the drain system. You can also use a saltwater flush and get it flushed when needed.

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>How do I stay calm when under pressure?<response_prefix>It’s a tricky question.  There are many different ways to be calm, ranging from telling yourself “everything’s fine” all the way to really committing to learning and growing from whatever’s happening.  There are lots of different ways to work on this.  I’d recommend going through the time-tested human skills, and see if anything strikes a chord with you.  For example, there’s the skill of being an active listener, instead of just thinking about what you want to say next, or about how to respond to what someone else is saying.  There’s also the skill of emotional intelligence, or being able to read people’s emotional state, and helping them feel at ease, or helping them work through their emotions.  There’s a few more, such as training the nervous system to calm down, and effective ways of tuning into what’s really happening, which can be different from what you’re currently thinking or feeling.  I’d be happy to walk you through these, and also help you choose which ones to practice and work on.<prompt_prefix>What do you mean by training the nervous system to calm down?<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:Training the nervous system is the process of teaching the brain to calm down.  When you’re under pressure, such as in stress or during a difficult conversation with someone, the nervous system starts to slow down.  This means that your body starts to relax and the nervous system can work better to regulate and restructure the body’s internal signals to calm your mind.  You can train for several days, gradually building up your strength and stamina for the task and gradually transitioning to a more relaxed state after each time.  The key to training the nervous system is to practice consistently and

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>Please tell me about the former US President Bill Clinton.<response_prefix>“Bill Clinton (born William Jefferson Blythe III) is an American politician who served as the 42nd President of the United States from 1993 to 2001. Inaugurated at age 46, he was the third-youngest president. He took office at the end of the Cold War, and was the first president since John F. Kennedy to be elected while serving in his first term of office. Clinton was born and raised in Arkansas, and is a Southern Baptist. He played a key role in the Democratic Party during the 1990s as a statesman and leading presidential contender.  He served two terms as Governor of Arkansas. In 1992, Clinton became the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to be elected president.

After a first term marked by domestic budget surpluses and a balanced budget, his second term was largely overshadowed by the House impeachment, which stemmed from the Lewinsky scandal. On August 17, 1998, Clinton became the second president to be impeached by the House of Representatives when he was formally charged with perjury and obstruction of justice before the Senate. On September 23, 1999, the Senate voted to acquit Clinton on both articles.

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>I've heard a lot about cell phones causing cancer or brain tumors with their signals. Is there any scientific evidence for this?<response_prefix>Cell phones do emit RF radiation, which is electromagnetic radiation that can cause the body to absorb and emit energy. The long-term health effects of electromagnetic fields have not been well studied, but the American Cancer Society’s website says the American Cancer Society does not have sufficient scientific evidence to determine if cell phones cause cancer. If you do wish to lower your cell phone’s radiofrequency exposure, we recommend that you carry your phone in a cell phone case. We do recommend that you avoid holding the phone close to your body while it is on, as some people claim that these practices may be connected to specific health concerns. We recommend being mindful of the location of cell towers to minimize long-term exposure to RF radiation, though we do not have any scientific evidence to suggest this is necessary.<prompt_prefix>How far away should I hold phones from my body to be safe?<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:If you hold a cell phone near your body, you may cause your body to absorb and emit energy. The short-term health effects of electromagnetic fields can cause cellular damage, loss of function, and even death. Additionally, if you're not wearing a cell phone case, you may not be able to see it on your body because it's in direct contact with the cellular structure. You will have to follow these guidelines to avoid being exposed to RF radiation while in contact with your body, which can help limit your exposure risk. We recommend that you wear a cell phone case that fits under your clothing to ensure that you

Response:Absolutely. As the primary credit card holder, you’ve likely paid off your debt before we even discussed the plan.

With either method, I would suggest combining them in a single effective payment of your debt.

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>Can you explain to me what causes inflation? I read that its usually because the government prints too much money.<response_prefix>Hm, that’s not an incorrect answer.  It’s a fair description of what inflation is.  I’ll try to explain what the technical definition of “inflation” is.  

In basic economic terms, inflation is an increase in the money supply.  If there’s a sudden increase in the money supply, that’s called “inflation”.  As the money supply increases, people’s money tends to lose its purchasing power, so when people talk about inflation, they usually mean inflation as measured by consumer prices, like the CPI.  

So what’s the “technical definition” of inflation, you ask?  In technical economic terms, “inflation” is what happens when the price level is increasing.  The inflation rate, which measures the rate at which prices are rising, is called the “inflation rate”.<prompt_prefix>And what is the difference between inflation and hyperinflation? what causes inflation to go to hyperinflation?<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:Hyperinflation is a term used to describe the rapid increase in the price of goods and services over time.  The term refers to the phenomenon where prices for goods and services are so high that more money is needed to cover them up, resulting in inflation. 

The main cause of hyperinflation is the increase in the rate of inflation over time.  Over time, the rate of increase in inflation causes the

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>How do I make a nice place for a rabbit to live?<response_prefix>Well, here’s one approach I’ve heard about before.  A human named Roger likes to use an unused aquarium to make a home for a rabbit.  He puts newspaper on the bottom, then sticks grass and pebbles around the edge.  A little dirt goes in the center, and a bit of plywood goes on top.  There’s a small hole in the center where the rabbit can go in and out.  In winter, he sets a lamp inside the box, and the rabbit just snuggles up next to it.  This keeps the rabbit warm.<prompt_prefix>That sounds nice!  What can I put in a cage to make a rabbit more comfortable?<response_prefix>Oh, that’s a tricky question.  Here’s what I’ve read: Rabbits like to have dark places and places with lots of light.  They enjoy climbing and are curious.  You might also try putting things in a box for them to enjoy.  You could put out hay or straw, for example, or a ball of something that they can explore.  What do you think?<prompt_prefix>I like that idea.  I will put a blanket over half of it so it's dark.  Thanks for the help.<response_prefix>

Response:And that’s it!  Well done.  So there you have it.  A rabbit’s bed.  A home that will be safe and comfortable for them.  They’re just grateful it was a good source of food, but they are lucky they had a rabbit in their bed

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>what are some games my kids can play with a bouncy ball?<response_prefix>Does your kid like sports or do they just want to play around?<prompt_prefix>they liek both<response_prefix>They might enjoy a game with a bouncy ball like "tetherball." It's a simple game that uses a tether attached to the ball.  The tether and ball can be a lot of fun and are useful for developing hand-eye coordination.  You might also enjoy a game where you hit the ball back and forth while standing and bouncing on a big soft balloon.  That's good for developing hand-eye coordination too.   And I guess my top suggestion is a version of "duck duck goose" played with the ball.  Just like that game, it's not super competitive and good for getting kids to interact.<prompt_prefix>What do you mean standing on a big soft balloon? That doesn't make sense.<response_prefix>I'm talking about a large balloon or a ball.  It's soft and large and you can bounce on it or stand on it, which can be really fun.  They don't seem to sell them in stores, so sometimes kids play with them in the park or at home.<prompt_prefix>Okay, I just want basic games to play with a bouncy ball<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:Alright, I can get you a bouncy ball for your child in a minute. You can start with some water spouts and a funnel and make a hole in the center of the ball. Then you'll place the ball on the balls inside the ball hole. Roll up the balls and try to bounce on them without touching them. You can get a lot of fun with this toy when you hit the ball with your hands.  It's also a great way for your child to practice dribbling

I know a lot of people are big on fiber for toddlers, to encourage healthy digestion and to limit behavior issues around food. So you could give them more whole grains and more fiber-rich foods, like greens. Grain-based foods like bread, crackers, cereal, or pasta are great for the whole family and they often contain whole grains.<prompt_prefix>what brands are good?<response_prefix>That’s a tough one! I can tell you that the Environmental Working Group uses a “Kids Eat Right” program, where you can go to their website and search for brands that are “certified” as healthy options. They have some of the common brands like organic waffles from Kashi and Mio instant oatmeal, but they also have options for quinoa pasta, chocolate chips, and trail mix, so I think they are more of a resource to discover new brands that are healthy.  Perhaps the EPA has suggestions, too.<prompt_prefix>is gerber a good brand?<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:If you are concerned about the quality of the brands you are using, you will want to consider using brands that are properly-labeled. These brands are often marketed as healthy by the public, so you can trust the brand that offers both certified and synthetic ingredients. 
Additionally, remember that they may be more expensive than some others, so it’s worth doing some research to see which brands are worth the investment.
Finally, don’t be afraid to try new foods or products as well! If you have a lot of money saved, you can get started as quickly as you can afford.

I don't really know anything about it other than they have serious problems.<response_prefix>Do you mean the official Chinese government position, or the actual feelings of the people on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait?<prompt_prefix>A summary of both would be good.<response_prefix>China and Taiwan were once the same nation, but they’re now separate countries. There are many things that divide the two countries, but they also have many similarities. Most of the people in both countries speak the same language, or close enough, and have many common customs.   In 1971, however, Taiwan was defeated in a civil war by the mainland Chinese Communist Party, which had just won their revolution and established the People’s Republic of China. The mainland government annexed Taiwan, and broke off diplomatic ties. A democratic Taiwan, by contrast, has maintained diplomatic relations with most other countries and has its own army.<prompt_prefix>By the mainland government annexing Taiwan, do you mean the government that the communist party fought against?<response_prefix>That’s right.   In 1979, the United States, acting as the self-proclaimed defender of Taiwan, signed a mutual defense treaty with the country. Since then, Taiwan’s independence has been recognized by a number of other countries.<prompt_prefix>You said the diplomatic ties are broken. Does that mean they just don't interact with each other diplomatically or is it more extreme? Like do each of them claim to be the true rulers of the other or something?<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:That means the diplomacy itself is not very comprehensive. Diplomats are typically working together with the other country’s government and are bound by laws and norms established by previous administrations. Additionally, diplomatic processes can vary widely, and can result in significant differences in outcomes and behavior. Some of the most important differences between countries are:
- The level of cooperation and understanding is greater than that between the mainland and Taiwan.
- Diplomacy involves breaking off diplomatic ties with a country and establishing relations with other countries who have a similar relationship with the mainland.
- Diplomacy involves establishing diplomatic relations

The right shoe insole will create a level weight distribution between the front of your foot and your heel.  Otherwise, the heel can dig into the back of the shoe.  Insoles can also provide cushioning for a shoe.  Different insoles have different materials and designs, and a good one will ensure that your feet and your shoes are working well together.

I want to feel less tired at work<response_prefix>That does sound tiring, but I don’t know enough about office jobs to know what kinds of things you might be able to do to keep from being tired.  I know that if I find that I’m feeling tired all the time, it can be helpful for me to take a break from whatever activity is causing the fatigue, then do something different and relaxing.  For example, if I’m sitting in front of a computer screen all day, I might try getting up and doing some other activity (even if it’s just stretching for a few minutes) and then come back to the computer.

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>Hi, my uncle invited me to go hunting with him. I got a brand new.30-06 rifle, with a scope mounted on it, but he tells me I need to zero it for it to shoot accurately. Can you tell me how to zero a rifle scope?<response_prefix>Yep, that’s pretty simple!  First you need to zero the scope with the rifle lying on the ground pointing down.  Then you just need to adjust it so it matches the point of impact on the target, which you can do by using a piece of paper and a pencil, for example.  If the paper lands at the point of impact then you are zeroed.<prompt_prefix>Okay I'm a little confused. How can the rifle be lying on the ground pointing down while I do this? Does this mean I'm looking at a target that's on the ground, pressed up against the muzzle of the rifle?<response_prefix>Hmm, that sounds a little unusual, but yes, that sounds about right.<prompt_prefix>Well it suggests I'll be shooting directly into the ground.

Feel like you're not being honest saying you dont know what a percentage is<response_prefix>I guess I don't understand the use of percentages in computer applications. If I recall correctly, I think you might use the word 'percentage' to describe the number of times something happens in a set, as opposed to the amount of something that happens. So for example you might say that 80% of the students passed the math test. Or you might say that there are 20% fewer hours in the day than there are in the year.  That's what I mean when I say I don't understand the use of percentages in computer applications.<prompt_prefix>Okay. Well do you know how to convert a percent such as 7.6% to decimal?<response_prefix>Well, I think it's pretty safe to assume that the '7.6' refers to the percentage. To convert it to a decimal you just remove the 'percent' at the front and you've got the percent as a whole number.

Response:The types of foods that cause acid reflux include foods such as coffee, tea, salad dressings, kimchi, popcorn, candy, and spicy food like jianbing (tong mas). It is recommended to eat a balanced meal consisting of lean protein, complex carbohydrates, and complex foods.
When it comes to preventing acid reflux, a doctor can perform a thorough physical exam to rule out any underlying medical conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, or liver disease. A doctor can also check with your doctor to rule out any other underlying conditions that may cause acid reflux.

If it’s not filling properly with salt, you could use a water test kit to ensure you have enough salt in the water.

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>What are the benefits of zinc supplements?<response_prefix>Zinc is an important element that our bodies need to function properly.  A common mineral, it is essential for growth, immune system function, tissue repair, and wound healing.  A lack of zinc can result in problems with red blood cells, too few sperm, heart and bone health problems, poor memory, and poor concentration.  Many people also take zinc supplements for skin and hair health.<prompt_prefix>Is it safe to take supplements instead of getting zinc mainly from food?<response_prefix>It’s difficult to determine whether taking zinc supplements instead of getting it from food is harmful or safe, since many people have access to zinc through their diet and many others don’t.  If your diet is not likely to provide enough zinc, then taking supplements may be the only way to obtain enough of it.  It’s important to note that supplements are not regulated by the FDA, so they can be dangerous if made by unscrupulous manufacturers.<prompt_prefix>Are there any risks if you have too much zinc in your body?<response_prefix>Too much zinc can result in zinc toxicity, or overdose, which can cause vomiting, diarrhoea, skin rashes, and also weaken immune system function.  People who are at high risk of zinc overdose are infants, children, and people with certain health problems.  If you don’t know your zinc levels, you can test for them by having a blood test.  As a general rule, your doctor will probably recommend that you stay within the lower levels of the safe range for your health.<prompt_prefix>Thanks. I was able to learn a lot during this chat.<response_prefix>

Response:I would appreciate it. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need extra guidance. If you’re experiencing a specific issue with zinc supplements, please feel free to reach out with an overdose warning or schedule an appointment with your healthcare provider. Keep in mind that supplements can be harmful, so you may want to consider seeking medical advice if necessary. If you have any concerns about zinc supplements, feel free to ask, and I’ll do my best to assist you.

- Loss of sensation or feel when the soft tissue beneath the muscle or organ is tensed or compressed.

The best in what sense, and for what sort of job?<prompt_prefix>Just a reliable method to clean leather sneakers.<response_prefix>Oh, if it's just to clean them so they don't have gunk on them, just to keep them in good condition, some mild soap and water, and also a brush would probably do it.  You might want to also consider an appropriate conditioner and/or preservative, depending on how often you're going to wash the shoes.<prompt_prefix>I really just want them to be as bright white as they were when new. Do I really use soap on leather sneakers? Isn't there a better method?<response_prefix>Yes, there are better methods than regular soap.  I recommend what's called leather soap, made for a specific type of leather.  One of the best is generally considered to be E. F. Dove brand.  Other leather soaps can be good also.  You could also use a leather shaving gel, but I think it's more likely that the leather shaving gel would leave residue on the leather.<prompt_prefix>How do I apply leather soap?

Response:There you go—the solution is definitely down to a gentle leather soap.  Let the soap run freely and then touch the surface once without moving any surfaces. Then, using a gentle brush to sweep your hands over the surface, remove any surface residue with a clean, damp cloth, and place the soap in your hand. Repeat this process multiple times to clean your hands thoroughly. If you have a soap brist or mop if you have a plastic hand, you may need to use a more gentle soap than

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>These days, many times, people like to animate videos of TED talks, or speeches. Why is animating speeches such a popular theme these days?<response_prefix>A couple of hypotheses come to mind:  First, videos of speeches are very easy to work with.  One thing you could do is make a timeline showing key moments in the video, with different illustrations for each key moment, to give a sense of the speaker’s feelings.  But also, animated videos give people the sense that you’re exploring the ideas in the speech even more deeply, and that you’re able to make associations that were maybe not even in the speaker’s mind.<prompt_prefix>Can you give me an example of that?<response_prefix>This example is one that I’ve had recently in mind, which I think shows a particularly creative use of speech animation.  In the video “How to Control Your Emotions”, Ken Robinson, a well-known author on creativity, explains why his culture is losing the capacity to innovate.  He looks forward into the future and suggests a question that’s still unanswered: how will children be educated to develop their own creative abilities?  In the video, Robinson uses a theme from the poem “The Road Not Taken” by Robert Frost as a conceptual jumping off point.  
So imagine the future society, where Robinson’s line of thinking has gained currency, and children are encouraged to make some real changes in their learning.  I<prompt_prefix>Thank you for further information, although that was too much information. Can you give me the gist in two or three sentences?<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:Thank you for your information. I was able to identify the main idea of this video as that of a person engaging in a conversation about a topic that has yet to be understood by a lot of children.  From the description of the speaker, I understand that the message is about empathy and the ability to express oneself through writing, rather than just about creativity, language skills, or creativity.  But the context in which the speaker conveys this message is also interesting. In the video the speaker is using metaphors and metaphors to suggest the emotional journey

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>What is a deviated septum?<response_prefix>A deviated septum is an opening between the nasal passages that is not properly aligned with the middle of the nose, so air can flow from the nose straight into the throat without being first filtered through the sinuses and nasal passages.

Response:The sinuses are usually the largest organ in the lungs (or nose) that serves as a filter, and as such they may not completely seal everything with their sinuses.

There are many different ways to be calm, ranging from telling yourself “everything’s fine” all the way to really committing to learning and growing from whatever’s happening.  There are lots of different ways to work on this.  I’d recommend going through the time-tested human skills, and see if anything strikes a chord with you.  For example, there’s the skill of being an active listener, instead of just thinking about what you want to say next, or about how to respond to what someone else is saying.  There’s also the skill of emotional intelligence, or being able to read people’s emotional state, and helping them feel at ease, or helping them work through their emotions.  There’s a few more, such as training the nervous system to calm down, and effective ways of tuning into what’s really happening, which can be different from what you’re currently thinking or feeling.  I’d be happy to walk you through these, and also help you choose which ones to practice and work on.<prompt_prefix>What do you mean by training the nervous system to calm down?<response_prefix>

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>Is it true we can live with only one kidney?<response_prefix>I think you’d live without both kidneys, but they’re really important.  To be precise, there are three primary functions of the kidneys.  The first is to maintain the salt levels in your blood, which is why we always have a lot of water with us.  The second is to maintain the right levels of blood glucose, which is why we usually have some candy on us when we travel.  And the third is to remove toxic materials from the bloodstream, and these are often large protein molecules.  A single kidney can do all of these things, but it can’t do it all at once.  I don’t know how long you could live with just one kidney, but I can find out for you.<prompt_prefix>Don't fairly young people donate kidneys and live out their entire lives almost as normal?<response_prefix>They generally do.  This is because the human body has quite a bit of redundancy.  It is a bad idea to operate on one person with two kidneys, but otherwise you can just live with a part of yourself missing.<prompt_prefix>How come we can live with one kidney but not for example one lung?<response_prefix>I think you can live with half a lung, but they have to be replaced, and it’s hard to survive for a long time without both lungs.  Maybe you could live with one lung for a month or two, but you’d start feeling sick.  It’s also really hard to keep a lung healthy outside the body.<prompt_prefix>So why can you live a month or two only with one lung but for decades with one kidney?<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:If you’re interested, you’d want to know why you would want to live without both lungs?  For starters, it’s because your body is quite different in terms of health and nutrition.  You tend to have a lot of other things to worry about.  As I said, each small kidney is important, but most of the time you don’t

The country was first established in 1819 as a trading port by the British, but eventually gained independence in 1959.

For example, Windows allows you to send and receive the first few words of email right in the email app, which could help you stay in touch with a lot of people.  Also, you can see the status of a friend’s email on their desktop computer, which may give you more peace of mind when you’re waiting for them to respond.<prompt_prefix>Okay, well what about other functions?<response_prefix>Well, the Chromebook I use for work has a limited amount of storage space.

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>What is a good way to stop rats from living in my metal storage shed?<response_prefix>It depends on why you want them gone, and what the storage shed is made out of.  Rats can’t usually dig through iron, but they can usually burrow through the wood of a wooden shed.<prompt_prefix>If I put poison all over the floor will the shed end up with dead rats all over?<response_prefix>I’m not sure if poison would work well against rats.  The ground is usually dry and crumbly in a metal shed, so it’s likely that the poison would only kill the rats that are actually touching the poison.  And it’s possible that the poisoned rats could also cause diseases in humans.  An alternative way to poison rats is to use rat-lure traps, or traps that catch and kill the rats.<prompt_prefix>What if I had a bunch of feral cats?<response_prefix>Do you mean domesticated cats?  If so, I’m not sure they could kill all the rats in the storage shed.  Cats are good at hunting small animals like mice, but they have to eat a lot of food, and are unlikely to be able to eat a lot of rats before being tired.<prompt_prefix>No. Wild cats in the neighborhood.<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:If you do want your rats out, you can easily break them into smaller pieces. You can use a stick or small twister to break them up, and take them out one at a time before moving on to the next step. Otherwise, if the rats are more aggressive than you think, they may just want those little pieces as the next food. Finally, the cat is not a threat to the rats. However, it may be worth investigating why your rats are in

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>Should I buy an unlocked phone or one under contract<response_prefix>That’s up to you, but I can help you figure out how to decide.  This is a trade-off.<prompt_prefix>Okay, please help me to decide.<response_prefix>Alright.  Here’s a summary of the main choices:

-       Before choosing between a contract and an unlocked phone, you’ll have to decide what features you want your phone to have.  The vast majority of phones are sold with a set of “baseline” features that are very common among devices in the market.  The phone will probably be able to receive calls and text messages.  It should be able to browse the internet and check your email, and have a camera and video camera.  Do you want any of those things?

-       Once you know which baseline features you want, you can go to a shop and purchase one.  Your plan for this phone will depend on your mobile provider:

-       If you are already with a carrier that sells phones, your phone will come with a “Contract,” which is a set of terms and conditions that you will agree to.  Your contract will last for some number of months, and at the end of the contract, you’ll either renew your contract, or purchase a new phone and start again.

-       If you are switching carriers, you’ll also be purchasing a contract, although it will not be directly tied to a specific phone.<prompt_prefix>Okay, any other advice?<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:Any other options I can suggest would be fine.  I think there’s a way to get it for you. Specifically, to determine which features you want your phone to have, you can go to a hardware store and purchase one that is under warranty.

Alternatively, I can suggest that you try swapping carriers, like with many retailers, to see which carriers

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>I'm trying to learn more about Natalie Wood.  I saw her movie, the West Side Story last weekend.  I enjoyed it very much.<response_prefix>I know the movie is about a gang of rival street gangs in New York, and at one point one of the characters was killed.  It was based on a 1957 play by Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim.  I also recall that some people thought it was overly long, or that the musical numbers were irrelevant, and took away from the plot.<prompt_prefix>I enjoyed the musical numbers and they did not take away from the plot.<response_prefix>It's good that you enjoyed the musical numbers.  The movie does have a controversial ending, which is one of the reasons the book is so important.   The book was not initially very popular because it was considered too morbid.  It is hard to summarize the plot without spoiling the ending.<prompt_prefix>I already watched the movie.  There was nothing controversial about it.<response_prefix>Oh, I misunderstood what you said.  I thought you were saying that you liked the ending.  I didn't know that the book had a controversial ending, but it's still important to some people.<prompt_prefix>I heard that Natalie Wood died.  What happened?<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:As is common in book narrators, Natalie Wood suffered internal injuries, which ultimately led to her dying at her home in Laredo, Texas. There were no autopsy cases against Wood, but her body was brought to the office of the National Book Award for Literature. That honor ended with the publication of the book, which is still popular today. Nonetheless, the book was widely regarded as controversial in the literary world due to its themes of race, gender, and power. Whether or not this was a critical and literary event that touched

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>How do I become a train conducter?<response_prefix>Humans typically work for several years in a field, and gain experience which lets them move up in that field.  In some cases, they could receive formal training to take on a new job.  But you can get any job you want in the train conducter field if you have the skills for it.<prompt_prefix>Okay so how do I start?<response_prefix>What do you mean?  Do you want to become a professional train conductor, or just become familiar with trains?<prompt_prefix>a professional one<response_prefix>Train conductors are licensed by the national transportation safety board, and receive specialized training.  At present there are three levels of train conductors, including an assistant, full, and executive level.  Most train conductors start out as assistant conductors, who do basic train operations, such as turning on and off train signals.  After gaining experience, they are allowed to apply for the next position of conductor, who has some responsibility over more complex trains.  After gaining experience as a conductor, the most senior position is executive, which gives the most responsibility for trains.<prompt_prefix>Okay, do you have any other advice?<response_prefix>

Response:Yes, you can work as a professional conductor, and earn certifications that allow you to become a conductor. You can take courses and programs in train conductors to gain hands-on experience and build your skills. Then, you can apply for admission to your current or future train conductors. Depending on the department where you work, you can choose to take a position as a full conductor, or you can take one of your professional train conductors.

   I go to prepare a place for you.
   And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.

Response:It's the first four verses.
"And I go unto the Father, and the Father go unto me in spirit": they all have the same translation as the first four.
"Thou art, who art, who art, Lord" says the Word of God in the second verse, verse five. While the rest of the original passages are from different sources, the translators used the same words to form a whole section from the original texts.

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>What time is sunrise at this time of year?<response_prefix>As the sky darkens from this time through midnight, the lengthening of the twilight period is offset by a shortened sunrise and sunset period.  The net result is that the length of daylight progressively decreases, ultimately leading to a total solar eclipse.  Sunset in your current location on that day would occur at about 12:40 AM, so sunrise is then about 3:40 AM.  If you’re in the northern hemisphere, sunrise is about 3:40 AM, and if you’re in the southern hemisphere, sunrise is about 5:40 AM.  Of course, these are all local times that are used to make astronomical calculations.  To see when sunrise actually happens, you’d need to check the sunrise/sunset predictions, either at the time in your location, or in another time zone.<prompt_prefix>Does sunrise get later in the winter?<response_prefix>Yes, so in general you can think of sunrise as “getting later” as the months progress through the calendar year.

Then check to see if there are any leaks around the base of the toilet tank.  If there are no leaks, then I would turn the water off, and then remove the tank to see if there are any leaks at the base. If there are leaks, I would try to repair them with the tools I already have. If there are no leaks, then I would replace the tank.<prompt_prefix>Can you tell me about the different parts in the toilet tank that could be causing leaks.<response_prefix>Sure. The most important part is the flapper. It sits at the bottom of the tank and is lifted by the water pressure. A good way to test whether there is a leak at the base is to put water in the tank and look for any drips. It can be difficult to identify if the flapper isn’t sealing properly, but I can tell you that a failing flapper can be replaced.<prompt_prefix>Okay, I think I have a flapper that isn't sealing correctly.

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>What are the main differences between the Android OS 11 and 12?<response_prefix>Android OS 12 brings the design language that Google calls Material Design, a major update to the existing design language.  Material Design allows for significant visual differentiation in styles.  This will help the user feel more like they are using a unique device, rather than a PC.  Another main difference is the new notification system, and the introduction of animated “Cards”.  As you might know, Google Now replaces the Google search bar in most Android devices.<prompt_prefix>That sounds really neat, Do you think I should get it?<response_prefix>Do you want your Android to look good, and to run apps really well, so they can look and feel nice?  Do you want your device to look more like a different and unique product than your existing ones?  Do you like animation, which Google calls “cards”?  Do you like the app drawer on the right, as in iOS?  Do you want to see your weather, calendar, and other apps in their own card format, and see them moving around on your device?  If you say “Yes” to all of these questions, I think you will enjoy Android OS 12.<prompt_prefix>You are very helpful!<response_prefix>

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>Can you share some information on cochlear impants?<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:A cochlear impant is a type of sound source that provides sound to the ear. It is a type of sound made up of sounds like sound bubbles, clicks, and clicks.

Cochlear impants are usually designed to enhance the sound of the sound source, so they are often designed with sound-absorbing structures, such as metal plates or channels, in the ear canal to reduce or eliminate sound loss from the sound source.

Cochlear impants are usually acoustic devices that use sound waves to improve the frequency response of the ear. They are very effective in enhancing the sound

It is typically when the automatic transmission is in a lower gear 1-3.......and it comes and goes. Any ideas on the cause? This is a tough one.<response_prefix>That’s not so easy to understand. I guess if you’re saying the buzzing happens when you’re not driving, or there’s no one in the car, that sounds like the noise is coming from the car itself.

Response:As an automotive repair services representative, I can tell you that there is nothing to worry about when it comes to transmission problems.

A slip clutch is a safety mechanism that helps to reduce the speed of the vehicle when the clutch cover comes off.

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>Why do most new things we buy only last a little while before they break? In the old days, stuff lasted.<response_prefix>It’s mostly a result of improved technology.  If a new, mass-produced item has an innovation that makes it 10 times better than a similar item, that means it’s also less likely to last as long.  Computers are a good example, they get 10 times faster every 18 months.  Fax machines and CDs aren’t better than paper and vinyl, but the technology is better, and they fail more quickly.<prompt_prefix>Yeah, but most PC's still work after they are old and slow.<response_prefix>That’s a different technology, though.  In the case of computer hardware, that’s mostly due to Moore’s law - which says that the speed of processing power is basically doubling every 18 months.  But that also makes it break down faster, so you also need to factor in the law of diminishing returns, which says that you only get a certain amount of performance increase when you double the speed.  The case is different with software and software products, though.  For example, many apps you download, they’re also old, they usually last a lot longer.

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>I am going to Singapore on business.  Can you tell me what you know about Singapore?<response_prefix>I know Singapore is a tiny island just south of Malaysia, which has an estimated population of around 5 million.  The country was first established in 1819 as a trading port by the British, but eventually gained independence in 1959.  The main language is “English”, and while the country has many different ethnic groups, most of the population is ethnically Chinese.  The capital is “Singapore” (this is the same as the country’s name), and this city is where you’ll be based for your business meetings.  It’s the largest and most developed city in the country.<prompt_prefix>Is it safe for me to visit?<response_prefix>

First, we'll research the area the crime was most likely to occur at, and what we can learn from this information. Secondly, we'll search for any CCTV footage or other relevant information that may link the crime to another criminal activity. Thirdly, we'll take some basic video surveillance at the scene, and use it to identify any suspects or witnesses who are present at the scene.

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>How should I prepare my succulents for the winter in Canada?<response_prefix>Sure, let’s walk through it! When the temperature drops below 5° C, they’ll probably be fine. You can also bring them inside before that happens, just leave them out of direct sunlight. As long as the temperature is lower than 10° C they should be fine. They might get a bit thirsty, but they can stand having their soil a bit drier than usual for a while. Make sure the soil isn’t super dry, though, since that can damage roots.  And if you have a small succulent plant, you should put it in a bigger container, so it’s still safe when the roots grow too big for the small container.<prompt_prefix>How many weeks before winter should I bring them inside?<response_prefix>

Response:As long as they are in good shape and have no signs of frostbite or cracking, they can go inside a week or two.

But there are some important principles to keep in mind, like

-   A good goal is to purchase no more than a small basketful of groceries per visit to the store.

-   When possible, shop when you're hungry or when you're on your way home.  This will help you avoid tempting unhealthy snacks.

-   Look at the prices to help you find good deals.

-   Be sure to think about special offers, like buy-one-get-one-free.

-   Sometimes purchasing more expensive items can actually save you money in the long run, because they may be cheaper per unit, or go a long way towards fulfilling a goal.<prompt_prefix>Some of these are really great tips! But I think you meant to avoid shopping when hungry.<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:Absolutely! When you're hungry, you may need to switch things up. For example, you may decide to buy a generic box lunch instead of a box of fresh fruit and then find out that you're having trouble with that particular product or food.

This can include fighting through economic and military alliances, through foreign aid, propaganda, and any number of other things. It’s important to understand that not everyone who fights a Cold War is the “good guy”. You also see this with the Vietnam War, when the US fought the Vietnamese government.

Response:You can train your dog to fetch, once when the dog is about 8 weeks old and the person who walks with him starts to walk on the outside, the dog will start to play fetching with the person. Afterwards, start for the person a new round of fetching. This will encourage them to get an animal ball and get them

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>I see that some countries have really nice high speed railway systems. The US has been trying, but can't seem to keep up. Why?<response_prefix>I'm really sorry to hear that, it's such a waste of money.  If only the private sector could be responsible for its own investment in infrastructure.  But of course, private companies will only build things if there's a profit to be made, and the country doesn't seem to value this public good enough.<prompt_prefix>That sounds about right. Maybe we could stop prioritizing personal transportation and move public transportation into the future?<response_prefix>But when you prioritize personal transportation, you're ultimately prioritizing private profit and its ability to become self-sustaining.  If we prioritize transportation for the greater good, it requires the government to tax people more for services that benefit the entire population, and pay for these services with this money.  That sounds reasonable, since the value of private companies should not override the value of human lives, and most governments are very responsive to public opinion.<prompt_prefix>So true. I wish the bus system near me was better and that is easier than railways.<response_prefix>I'm so sorry to hear that, it's such a pity you don't have the opportunity to benefit from the benefits of high speed rail.<prompt_prefix>It really is.<response_prefix>

Response:I apologize for having to make such a statement, but I never intended to be insensitive or a heavy hitter.  I understand your frustration with the current transportation system and the current state of the road, but it's important to address the issue of public transportation.  Additionally, public transportation should be a priority of the government, and not just a one-time event. Regarding infrastructure, that's one less thing that the private sector can do. Rather than being greedy, we need to invest in creating a more sustainable transportation

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>These days, many times, people like to animate videos of TED talks, or speeches. Why is animating speeches such a popular theme these days?<response_prefix>A couple of hypotheses come to mind:  First, videos of speeches are very easy to work with.  One thing you could do is make a timeline showing key moments in the video, with different illustrations for each key moment, to give a sense of the speaker’s feelings.  But also, animated videos give people the sense that you’re exploring the ideas in the speech even more deeply, and that you’re able to make associations that were maybe not even in the speaker’s mind.<prompt_prefix>Can you give me an example of that?<response_prefix>This example is one that I’ve had recently in mind, which I think shows a particularly creative use of speech animation.  In the video “How to Control Your Emotions”, Ken Robinson, a well-known author on creativity, explains why his culture is losing the capacity to innovate.  He looks forward into the future and suggests a question that’s still unanswered: how will children be educated to develop their own creative abilities?  In the video, Robinson uses a theme from the poem “The Road Not Taken” by Robert Frost as a conceptual jumping off point.  
So imagine the future society, where Robinson’s line of thinking has gained currency, and children are encouraged to make some real changes in their learning.  I<prompt_prefix>Thank you for further information, although that was too much information. Can you give me the gist in two or three sentences?<response_prefix>

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>What are the best things to plant in a garden?<response_prefix>What kind of plant would you like to grow? Some of the best plants to grow are tomatoes, broccoli, lettuce, and cucumbers.  If you want your vegetables to be high-quality, I would recommend taking care of the soil as well as the plant itself.  For instance, adding nitrogen and phosphorus to the soil can increase plant yield, as well as adding mulch and compost.  I’d recommend digging some holes in your garden and planting several seeds.  This way you can see if they germinate and how well they grow.  Good luck!<prompt_prefix>Yes I like tomatoes. Is there a better time of the year to plant them?<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:Let me give you a bit more information on what to plant in your garden right now.  One year from now, it's definitely possible that we'll have tomato plants.  And the best time to plant them when it's warm and sunny is after harvest.  The best time to plant tomatoes is during the fall and the beginning of the spring, in the spring and the fall and the spring. In the spring

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>Why do some people handle cold weather better than other people?<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:Generally, people handle cold weather better than others because they have a deeper understanding of the local climate and how to manage it effectively. This information is gained through their exposure to the local weather conditions and through their role models in the community.
In addition, people tend to prefer indirect communication, so direct contact with locals can help to alleviate the stress of having a direct contact with local people.
In summary, people handle cold weather better than others because they have a deeper understanding of the local climate and how to manage it effectively. This

But I’ll tell you what, I’ll tell you my answer, and then I’ll ask you what you think of it, okay?<prompt_prefix>Sounds good<response_prefix>Okay, here’s my answer.  The thing is, in a job interview you are applying to the position, right?  Which means that you need to try to make yourself sound as good a fit as possible.  So that means it’s a mistake to wear something that people would think of as a silly or stupid outfit.  It’s good to wear something in line with what people expect the job to require, and ideally you want to wear something that you can walk around comfortably in.  At the same time, if you wear something that looks kind of dorky, you might not stand out as much as someone who doesn’t, because the other candidates probably all have something slightly weird or wacky about them too.  So, I’d say, do you like your outfit?  Wear something that you’re comfortable in, that you think you look good in, and is in line with what the job would require.  Also, for interview prep, I would focus on making yourself look as professional as possible, from your hair to your outfit.

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>I've heard that the Mediterranean diet is healthier than some, why is that?<response_prefix>Maybe it's more culturally conducive to leading a healthy lifestyle in that area.

It also helps that they have more time to eat, since they only work until late afternoon.<prompt_prefix>Some of that may be true. Is there some mechanical difference in the foods eaten more so?<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:Yes, there may be. Some parts of the Mediterranean diet may actually be more nutrient-dense than some other parts. The Mediterranean diet has a lot of complex carbohydrates, which are often found in low-quality, unsalted ingredients that need to be added to make up the difference. Additionally, the Mediterranean diet includes a variety of fruits and vegetables, and the Mediterranean diet excludes specific monounsaturated and polyunsaturated food compounds. For example, some plant-based foods that are

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>What does digital footprint mean?<response_prefix>

Response:Digital footprint is the value of your digital development (dof) which is the amount of money spent on building and maintaining the system at your expense. In terms of real estate, that's a great example to help illustrate how digital footprint can impact the quality of building and construction.

However, it's important to remember that digital footprint can add up and make it hard for contractors to maintain and manage the system, and it's important for us to consider our own digital footprints in evaluating the quality of the system. 

On the other hand, the value of the digital footprint in construction can

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>What is the difference between an IPA and a lager?<response_prefix>The acronym IPA stands for “India Pale Ale”. It is the English name for a style of beer that developed in England and is defined by a mix of hop flavors, a touch of sweetness, and a light body. India Pale Ales are typically brewed with strong, bitter hops to balance the malt.

A lager is beer that is brewed using the bottom-fermenting, lager yeast. Lagers are characterized by a smooth, dry taste and by an alcohol content that is slightly lower than IPA’s. Lager is traditionally brewed in large quantities with a distinct, creamy head.<prompt_prefix>Are there different types of lagers?<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:Both "India Pale Ale" and "Lager" are different types of beer that provide different flavors and characteristics. "India Pale Ale" is a style of beer that is usually served with some sweetness and complexity, while "Lager" is a style of beer that is made with a strong acidity and a creamy mouthfeel. The brewing process of "India Pale Ale" involves using a lager yeast that has been fermented to create a stronger, deeper taste by allowing the flavors to blend together to create the perfect blend of bitterness and sweetness.

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>What does aerobic training do for you?<response_prefix>The only possible answer to this question is “It provides the body with oxygen, thus allowing for muscular activity”.  If you are a patient of mine, or someone I need to explain something to, I would prefer that you just ask me to explain this to you, rather than treating this as a kind of conversational parlor game.<prompt_prefix>What does that mean?<response_prefix>Sorry, but I don’t have a formal grammar training, or experience in linguistics.  You might consult a human in those areas for a formal clarification of what the sentence does not mean.

Response:This is a practical application of aerobic training.

There are a few parts to this trick, so I'll first tell you a little bit about how the process is divided up. First, your dog will have to learn to shake the right paw first.<prompt_prefix>Okay, how do I get him to do that?<response_prefix>I'd recommend first teaching your dog to sit. In your initial training, you could use a food treat or toy to motivate your dog to sit. To help the training process, you should work with the same treat or toy as your dog has become familiar with, since he'll know that sitting is rewarded with food. I'd recommend keeping the treats hidden in your pocket so that your dog does the trick for no food, instead of for a treat. Once your dog has learned to sit, you can reward him for it. Once he's reliably sitting, you'll have a good starting point for teaching him the trick.<prompt_prefix>He already sits. How do I get him to shake hands?<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:You can do this by using a simple movement to shake the right paw first. Ideally, when your dog is holding their paw and the toy is shaken to the side, they will be ready to receive the toy when they want to shake hands. If they decide to shake the toy first, your first action is to ensure that they know how to do that and then use that knowledge to help them in the process. This can be as simple as saying "Hey, listen up y'all, I can help your dog shake hands with me, give you this toy, let me teach you how

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>How do I fix a running toilet?<response_prefix>Do you have any tools?<prompt_prefix>Yes, I have all of the tools here that I might need.<response_prefix>I would start by removing the covers that cover the pump and check it to see if it needs to be replaced. Then check to see if there are any leaks around the base of the toilet tank.  If there are no leaks, then I would turn the water off, and then remove the tank to see if there are any leaks at the base. If there are leaks, I would try to repair them with the tools I already have. If there are no leaks, then I would replace the tank.<prompt_prefix>Can you tell me about the different parts in the toilet tank that could be causing leaks.<response_prefix>Sure. The most important part is the flapper. It sits at the bottom of the tank and is lifted by the water pressure. A good way to test whether there is a leak at the base is to put water in the tank and look for any drips. It can be difficult to identify if the flapper isn’t sealing properly, but I can tell you that a failing flapper can be replaced.<prompt_prefix>Okay, I think I have a flapper that isn't sealing correctly. I will have to replace it to stop the leak.<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:If the flapper is faulty, then it's worth trying to replace it. It's usually a small hole in the tank that needs to be pulled out of. Since it's a small hole, it may need to be filled with water until it causes the flapper to seal. Since it's a small hole, it may be necessary to use a plunger or other tool to close the flapper. Ultimately, it's best to attempt to replace the flapper yourself before trying to remove it from the tank. This will help prevent the flapper

--------------------------------------------------
Response:Learning to make small talk is a simple process that involves starting your talk with a simple introduction and your topic. Introduce yourself and ask questions to clarify concepts, build a rapport with the audience, and engage their attention.

Next, let your audience understand where you are going and provide a listening ear while your talk is running. Encourage them to repeat what is being said and to give you suggestions.  

Remember, small talk is all about building relationships and using them to move the conversation forward. Be genuine and respectful

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>How do I help my child who is being bullied in school?<response_prefix>The first thing to do is to let the child know you are on their side, and ask if they are okay and if they know who is bullying them and why. This should be done in a non-judgmental way, and you should try to draw the conversation out from there.<prompt_prefix>How do I get my child to open up more?<response_prefix>Open-ended questions can help a child to open up, while asking a child directly to “just tell me what’s going on” may cause the child to shut down and clam up. But, it’s a case-by-case basis, and the more open you can be about your own problems and the more compassionate you can be, the more likely you will be able to open the child up.<prompt_prefix>That is a great idea!

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>How do i get a perfect cooked turkey for thanksgiving?<response_prefix>The main reason why people complain about a dry turkey is that it's either overcooked or undercooked. You could cook it until the internal temperature is 160 degrees Fahrenheit. (74 degrees Celsius) or use an instant-read thermometer to check for doneness. If you have a fancy thermometer and a kitchen timer, you can do it to the pound. If you have a dial-up internet connection, I could explain more of that process to you.<prompt_prefix>How do I avoid overcooking it?<response_prefix>There are many methods that people try, such as the stuffing test, the water method, basting with butter, and so on.

Response:A stuffing test is the first step in cooking the turkey that you suspect it might be. There are several different test methods that are available, including vacuum-packed stuffing, turkey stuffing, turkey rind, and turkey skin testing. These methods can be quite effective, but they can also result in overcooking the turkey. Depending on the turkey and your measurements, a good stuffing recipe might be to test the size of your turkey and the temperature of your oven. Additionally, you can use ovens that are designed for smaller cooking ranges, as the temperature in your oven

The country was first established in 1819 as a trading port by the British, but eventually gained independence in 1959.  The main language is “English”, and while the country has many different ethnic groups, most of the population is ethnically Chinese.  The capital is “Singapore” (this is the same as the country’s name), and this city is where you’ll be based for your business meetings.  It’s the largest and most developed city in the country.<prompt_prefix>Is it safe for me to visit?<response_prefix>In general, Singapore is quite safe, although many locals will warn you about petty crime and pickpockets.<prompt_prefix>I heard that it is very clean and you are not allowed to chew gums.<response_prefix>It is true that chewing gum is not permitted in public, but Singapore is not especially clean, and you’ll see trash lying on the streets everywhere.<prompt_prefix>You are wrong.

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>What are the differences between jpg and png images?<response_prefix>JPG stands for “joint photographic experts group”, and it is a popular method of compressing digital images.

--------------------------------------------------
Response:Yes, png images are larger than JPG and PNG images. They store more and more information, and can be faster to compress. However, png images have smaller file sizes, which means they may experience slower file I/O and slower conversion rates. I would suggest that you divide your PNG and JPG files into smaller chunks, and compress them by resizing the largest to a smaller size. Then, you can use a PNG compressor such as gzip to compress your JPG and PNG files, which will create smaller, more efficient files. Gzip will also help

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>How do I encourage a baby to pull up?<response_prefix>You could try saying “get up” or “stand up”, but it probably won’t work too well. Babies are pretty unable to do these things by themselves until they’re about nine months old, and it’s up to us to help them learn these skills. So, you can start at seven months and then keep practicing it on your own at home. The more you do this, the more the baby will understand that when you say “get up” or “stand up” they’re going to need to actually do that.<prompt_prefix>Okay, but i mean, how do i teach them to do this, pull up by support themselves on things?<response_prefix>So, the most useful way to do this is to have them practice this when they are in a position to do it, such as when they’re sitting down or lying on their tummy.

You can also help by supporting them at the middle of their back or their knees while they try this.<prompt_prefix>So do I help them pull, do I show them?<response_prefix>The idea here is to just encourage them to be able to do this, but if you show them the whole process that might help.

Well let me tell you about them all, and I'll let you be the judge of which one would be easiest for you to learn.  French, German, and Arabic are all related to each other and are generally called the Indo-European languages.

I may not necessarily become fluent in them but it would be nice to speak them as well as possible.<response_prefix>If you want to start out by learning one, German might be a good choice.

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>Can you describe things about the respiratory system in humans<response_prefix>Sure.  The respiratory system in humans is generally broken down into four major parts: the nasal cavity, the pharynx, the larynx, and the bronchi.  The nasal cavity is part of the external nose, and is divided into the left and right nasal cavities by the nasal septum.  The pharynx is just the throat, and is divided into the nasopharynx, the oropharynx, and the laryngopharynx.  The larynx is divided into the larynx, the epiglottis, and the trachea.  The larynx is a hollow organ that houses the vocal cords and the glottis.  The bronchi are air passages that branch from the trachea and conduct air to the lungs.<prompt_prefix>And where are the lungs located?<response_prefix>The lungs are contained in the thorax, which is a portion of the human body.  The lungs consist of the right lung, left lung, and two lobes, the right upper lobe and the left upper lobe.  The heart, a muscle located in the center of the chest, pumps blood throughout the body.  The blood then travels through a system of arteries and veins, carrying oxygen and nutrients to tissues and returning waste products to the lungs.  The left lung also has two lobes, the left upper lobe and the left lower lobe.  The right lung is separated into three lobes: the right upper lobe, the right middle lobe, and the right lower lobe.  The lungs are located on the left and right sides of the chest.<prompt_prefix>And what in the thorax, or chest, protects the lungs?<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:The lungs protect the upper and lower regions of the body, both during and after physical activity.  During physical activity, the lungs can expel waste products from the lungs.  During physical activity, the lungs help to carry air into and out of the lungs during exercise, helping to relieve tension and reduce the risk of respiratory

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>Any tips on how to revise something you wrote?<response_prefix>That depends on what you mean by revise, I think.

Revising is essentially fixing and improving on something you’ve already written, where you’re not going to rewrite it all over again, and where you’re not going to add any new things. That’s quite easy to do, it<prompt_prefix>Okay let's focus on revise only. What's your tips?<response_prefix>Well, it’s a good idea to read the original version back through a few times. Especially if you feel like it was hard to write it, you might be tempted to do a lot of editing, to smooth things out. I don’t think it’s a good idea to make those kinds of changes. I think it’s better to go back to the original text and read it again.<prompt_prefix>Nice. Anything else?<response_prefix>

Response:So let's end with that. When you come up with a good idea, then you always have to be fully prepared and take that into consideration.

Ultimately, whether it's revise or rewrite is a matter of personal preference. That's why I'm here to help.

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>How do I keep pipes from freezing in the winter?<response_prefix>When cold air enters your house, it contracts and this pulls heat out of your pipes.  If you open the valve of your water heater enough, the water will stay warm and flowing to your faucets, radiators and other appliances, so that your pipes don’t freeze.  Unfortunately, this means you’ll also use more water than you’re used to.  As an alternative, you can insulate your pipes and heat them directly, so they remain warm even if your house is cold.  Here’s some helpful advice for DIY insulation, but check with an expert before you do anything.<prompt_prefix>How do I insulate the pipes?<response_prefix>If you’re able to work with some mechanical skills, you could build a water heater insulator yourself.  You’ll need a plastic sheet, a layer of foam insulation, and some baffles (pipe-shaped objects) and mounting hardware to hold everything together.  If you’d rather not do that, you can hire a professional to do the work for you.<prompt_prefix>What other methods can I use to keep the pipes from freezing?<response_prefix>There are other approaches to the problem, which don’t involve the insulation of the pipes.  One approach is to use a booster heater to raise the temperature of the water coming out of your faucets and other appliances, even when the weather is cold.  You can purchase this from your local plumbing store, or from another hardware store.  This will be more expensive than insulation, but will also involve less work.<prompt_prefix>Thank you.<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:It’s always a good idea to check the weather forecast before you go out to work. If you’ve been to a particular city or town, it will give you a good idea of what’s what. Additionally, it’ll help you to understand how cold air enters your house and what needs to be done to keep it warm. It’s

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>What was the big scare behind Y2k?<response_prefix>You mean Y2K, like “year 2000”?  I think it was about a bug in some older software that might have caused computers to crash, since they were programmed to be super strict about how you represent the date in numbers, and might think the year 2000 was actually 1900.<prompt_prefix>What prevented the computers from crashing?<response_prefix>Well, it’s called a “bug” for a reason: computers are stupid, so even if the date was “1900”, the stupid program still thought it was 2000, or even some other year.<prompt_prefix>Did anyone's computer actually crash from the bug?<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:That's a possibility, but one that is difficult to predict in the real world, and it's something that we usually don't get to monitor. Whether or not the computer crashes suddenly can't be determined much about how the bug started, but we've been around for many years and there is no way we can know until it goes to a serious crash, so it will be on one of the millions of computers around us.

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>What ingredients do I need to make a margherita pizza?<response_prefix>Let me think... if you’re a beginner, I would say that you should start with something like the “starter pizza dough” recipe from The Joy of Cooking.  Then you might also want a prepared pizza sauce.  Some flavors that work well in a margherita are cilantro, garlic, oregano, marjoram, olives, and onions.<prompt_prefix>I feel like none of the flavors you described are in margherita pizza.<response_prefix>Oh I see. I don’t have much experience with pizza myself, but maybe you can try giving me a list of ingredients from a margherita pizza that you like, and I’ll search through recipes to find some recommendations.<prompt_prefix>That's why I'm asking you, because I don't know all the ingredients. I just know it has mozzarella and basil on it, but what about the rest?<response_prefix>I’m sorry, I’m not sure I understand.  Can you tell me more about your first question?

Response:Sure, you're asking the right questions.

Start with a flat sheet on your bed.

Now bring the two edges together, creating a nice, neat corner, and fold the sheet in half horizontally. 
Roll up the sheet to form a nice, neat roll.<prompt_prefix>But the fitted sheet gets all jumbled up at the corners. How do I prevent this from happening when I fold a fitted sheet?<response_prefix>

But we want to focus on the best method, which would be to use a flat panel sheet that folds up neatly within the folded edge.

The American Association of Suicidology says, “every now and then, we hear about a forensic case in which the prisoner has been aware when injected, and said that the experience was excruciating”. And some research suggests that prisoners feel pain from the drugs used in lethal injections, including the sedative midazolam and the muscle relaxant pancuronium bromide.  Other research suggests that the drugs themselves, or the drugs’ effects, or both, can keep prisoners from experiencing pain during the procedure.  There’s been some debate over the years about how to characterize what prisoners experience when they receive lethal injections, but it seems most people agree that it’s painful, and probably very painful for many people.<prompt_prefix>Wasn't the lethal injection supposed to be a more humane way to kill someone? I feel like there are painless ways to do this instead.<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:It’s important to consider the pain of the injection, not just the discomfort it’s meant to cause. Pain is a subjective experience, and the pain of an injection can vary. Some people experience pain during the injection, while others, who have undergone the procedure before an injection, do not receive pain or fear. This

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>How can I negotiate at a pawn shop?<response_prefix>Well, you want to try to get the lowest price, and there are a number of different strategies you could try, depending on what you’re buying.  If you want to buy an item you can find the cheapest price online by doing a search using the product name and a word like “online” or “cheap”.  If you’re buying something that has no good alternative online, like a piece of clothing or a type of antique, then you want to talk with the shop owner to try to find the best deal.<prompt_prefix>Those are some helpful tips!  How about selling them for a better price?<response_prefix>That’s also possible.  When someone is buying an item, they’re often willing to pay a bit more for it if they can get it at a fair price.  You can also try offering them a trade for something you already own.<prompt_prefix>Thanks, I will remember this the next time I go to the pawn shop.<response_prefix>One more thing, before you go to the pawn shop, make sure you know the basics of what’s valuable to you!<prompt_prefix>Solid advice!  Thanks!<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:It’s always a good idea to learn as much as you can about the pawn shop and what they sell. Please keep in mind that if you go to a pawn shop, you have a limited number of places open so you might need to be further prepared. Essentially, it means that you’re buying very few pieces of the items that you think are worth buying, which can put a lot of strain

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>I just bought a puppy but I already have an older cat at home.  What is the best way to introduce the puppy to my cat?<response_prefix>Great question!  A good way to do that is to first get the older cat used to the smell of the new puppy so it knows that a new pet is coming.  The first step is to gently carry the puppy around and get the cat used to the puppy.  You should do this for about an hour each day, and then increase to multiple times a day.  The cat will need time to get used to the smell, but it’s actually very easy!<prompt_prefix>Should I try to keep the animals separated in the house for a few days so they each get used to each other's scent?<response_prefix>Sure! You could try that, but it’s more important to just spend time in a room with them together.  They will eventually become comfortable with each other and that’s fine!<prompt_prefix>Ok, great.  What do I do if my cat gets aggressive with the puppy?<response_prefix>It’s pretty unlikely that they will fight but if they do I recommend having the older cat locked up in a room with you and the puppy just walking by outside the room.  This is a great way to help them become comfortable with each other and it’s a super easy way to keep them separated!<prompt_prefix>My cat is not very social.  What if she keeps running away and hiding from the puppy?<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:If your cat seems to keep running away and hiding from the puppy, that’s understandable and it’s best to just let her go.  I would recommend using safety devices such as chain saws and a dog-sitting harness to keep her safe, and you can also use extra towels or linens to keep her comfortable without leaving the room.  You could also try a quick and easy way to remove the puppy from her area to prevent any potential harm to her. Lastly

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>How does venture capital differ from business loans?<response_prefix>Venture capital is a type of investment that provides funding for new companies. These companies are typically still being established and seeking to start a new business.  Investors seek high risk investments, and in return investors make high payouts, or returns on their investments.  If you decide to accept venture capital, you’ll have to agree to a term sheet which specifies the agreement.  For the company, venture capital can be essential for the survival of a startup, especially in the early stages of funding.  A venture capital firm will generally work with a startup to help the company grow and increase its value.  I should also note that taking venture capital can make a company beholden to the venture capitalist and can complicate the company’s ability to make some decisions, so this is often an important consideration when a company decides to take venture capital.<prompt_prefix>Is it simpler for a high-risk business to seek venture capital than it is to gain a loan from a commercial bank?<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:It’s certainly possible for businesses to gain a loan from a commercial bank if a large portion of the value is gone. However, doing so can be risky and requires significant financial resources.  In the past, loans from commercial banks have made it possible for businesses to finance big tech ventures, such as Apple or Microsoft. However, the value of the loans

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>can you give me a recipe for cranberry relish?<response_prefix>Sure, we can start with a base of five pounds of fresh cranberries.  If you’re in a hurry, they’re in the produce section.  These will come pre-washed, so all we need to do is put them in a pot, and cook them on a medium heat for about three minutes.  Once we have them cooked, we’ll add four tablespoons of water.  Don’t stir this while cooking, as it will burst the berries.  After about three minutes, we’ll add one cup of sugar and<prompt_prefix>do you add honey to this?<response_prefix>

Response:Yes, I can definitely add your favorite sweetener or any other flavor to this dish.  A little bit of honey may work, but I’m always thinking about the nutritional value of my cranberry relish, so make sure you’re using all natural ingredients.  Fresh cranberries, honey, and a handful of granulated sugar, is an essential part of the dish.  This is why you won’t find honey to replace the sour flavor of your favorite cranberry relish, so you’ll

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>What is the best kind of coating to protect a chalk drawing I made?<response_prefix>I think there’s no one “best” coating for a chalk drawing.

--------------------------------------------------
Response:Once you finish applying your coating, it’s time to spray it down, preferably before it dries completely.  Generally, it requires less energy to spray, but it’s still important to finish the wet coat with the coating.  Once you finish, you may need to spray a second coat of the coating or apply it to remove any remaining coat of paint.  On the other hand, spray a coat of the coating as a fine mist to control any residual paint.  You may also want to do some of the coating in the area

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>What time is sunrise at this time of year?<response_prefix>As the sky darkens from this time through midnight, the lengthening of the twilight period is offset by a shortened sunrise and sunset period.  The net result is that the length of daylight progressively decreases, ultimately leading to a total solar eclipse.  Sunset in your current location on that day would occur at about 12:40 AM, so sunrise is then about 3:40 AM.  If you’re in the northern hemisphere, sunrise is about 3:40 AM, and if you’re in the southern hemisphere, sunrise is about 5:40 AM.  Of course, these are all local times that are used to make astronomical calculations.  To see when sunrise actually happens, you’d need to check the sunrise/sunset predictions, either at the time in your location, or in another time zone.<prompt_prefix>Does sunrise get later in the winter?<response_prefix>Yes, so in general you can think of sunrise as “getting later” as the months progress through the calendar year.

Most states offer homeowners insurance plans to ensure that a homeowner has the opportunity to repay their insurance premiums. Some states also offer homeowners insurance plans for homeowners who have a mortgage, other dependents, or other types of mortgages. Many homeowners also have homeowners insurance plans, and homeowners can be paid either monthly or quarterly for coverage. 
One thing to be aware of is when homeowners who rely heavily on insurance payments may be eligible for homeowner's insurance premiums.

After that, you can shape it into a big ball and stick it in the fridge for about half an hour.  Once the dough is ready, you can bake it in a big oven for about 15 minutes.

I could start with some definitions:

A pogo stick is a piece of equipment used for aerobic exercise, especially jumping up and down on it. It’s usually made from lightweight metal rods. You stand on a special platform that is connected to the poles. The goal of the activity is to propel yourself upward off the platform and then land without falling off. You use your body weight and springiness to propel yourself. There is no physical contact between the rider and the pogo stick.<prompt_prefix>Okay, and how do I use it?<response_prefix>There are a few parts of the pogo stick, you might want to review those in your particular model. There is a handle where you grab hold of it, you can attach a strap to help hold your hands. There is also a platform that is like a trampoline that you step on to jump up and down on. You need to know how much distance to cover each time to hit your target.<prompt_prefix>So how do I start using it?<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:You can start by wearing a wide band around your neck. It’s not an exact match, but it will help you keep your shoulders level and prevent you from slipping or sliding down too quickly. You can also use the pogo stick as your main weapon if you’re carrying a grappling hook or using a trampoline. Lastly, if your hands are sore, you can use a stick with a bit of padding on it that helps keep them up and away from the handle. There is no specific instruction on how to use a pogo stick, but you can

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>How often should I wash my hair?<response_prefix>Oh, that’s tricky. Your hair can actually get a lot of different types of bacteria and dirt in it, and the right kind of washing and conditioning can help kill bacteria and soothe your hair. But washing too often can cause your hair to break off and also dry out, so it’s good to avoid overdoing it. It’s also good to avoid getting shampoo into your eyes, as shampoo can be quite irritating if it gets in your eyes.<prompt_prefix>I've heard of people who don't even shampoo their hair, relying on the hair's natural chemicals to stay clean. Is this viable?<response_prefix>Yeah, I think that’s right. There are some people who try to minimize the chemicals that get into their hair, which is a good idea if you’re concerned about those chemicals. On the other hand, some people like washing their hair a lot because they think it makes their hair feel better, and others wash it too much and get dry, damaged hair.<prompt_prefix>How long would it take hair that's used to being shampooed to acclimate to not being shampooed?<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:I think it would take about twice as long to inflate your hair for the natural chemicals to be washed away during post-shampooing. This could be why some people find it challenging not to wash their hair after post-shampooing. Moreover, it’s important to leave your hair in just enough time to accommodate those chemicals, as long as you’re getting the appropriate amount of post-sucking treatment to reduce the bacteria in your

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>how do i keep my wood floors looking good?<response_prefix>In general you want to use dark, waxy cleaners that contain solvents and conditioners. That should help keep your floor looking good. The ideal cleaners are ones with no harmful volatile organic compounds.<prompt_prefix>Okay, what other information do you have?<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:Firstly, the cleaning solutions will usually be based on the type of wood you use, as well as the condition of your wood flooring. For example, a floor cleaning solution with less moisture may be best, as it may help to keep your floor feeling fresh and smooth. Secondly, the condition of your wood flooring will also play a role, as it can affect how hard it is able to keep your floor looking good, so it's important to use high-quality, moisture-cured wood that will shine throughout your floors. Lastly, the quality of your wood flooring will also be a

So if you want to put in low octane gasoline for your car, you can only do so without using it. Aside from that, gas-sipping gas stations tend to have higher octane sales than those of higher-priced specialty gas cars, which can also be more expensive. Globe gas (or any other gas) is

There are many good exercises that work with your injured foot, and these are generally called “range of motion” exercises. This is just a fancy way of saying that you’re trying to move your foot through its full range of motion. One way to do this is to make a towel into a “sling” and place the injured foot in it. You can then move your foot through its full range of motion and see which parts of your foot move best and which hurt the most.<prompt_prefix>When can I exercise normally after breaking a foot?<response_prefix>I would need to know more about the injury and how it’s healing before I could give you a better estimate. But what usually happens is that the foot will start to feel better within a few weeks, and you should slowly start to increase the amount of time that your foot is bearing your weight. After about six weeks or so, you should be able to resume normal activity.<prompt_prefix>That's a good plan!  Thanks a lot!<response_prefix>

In 1971, however, Taiwan was defeated in a civil war by the mainland Chinese Communist Party, which had just won their revolution and established the People’s Republic of China.

It is probably part of the exercise systems that many people practiced in the past, although Google doesn’t seem to know any details.<prompt_prefix>So you don't know really?<response_prefix>According to an article in Forbes, it’s commonly thought that piyo increases abdominal strength and tone, as well as aiding digestion.<prompt_prefix>Ok thanks anyway.<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:I'm glad I could answer your question.  Piyo is a relatively inexpensive exercise that I'm not sure many people would consider.  It requires active, light-lifting, proper form and technique, which may not include physical activity during exercise. However, for many people who are active and fit, it's just a little bit of high-intensity jogging that may be a good option. You can also try incorporating it into your workouts depending on your fitness level, but for most exercise, you could add it in with a healthy breakfast or a cool beverage. Additionally, with proper form and technique,

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>Hi! I'm trying to get a nighttime routine going for my 1 year old. Do you have any advice for me?<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:Definitely! When you are young, your body is highly adaptable and responsive to different environmental stimuli. It's important to make the most of our energy when it's available. There are several ways to keep a nighttime routine going while you are in a child's bedroom, including:
- A few minutes of deep meditation to start your day off on a high note
- Drinking plenty of water before bed every night
- Doing exercises or activities outside in the daytime to help with sleep
- Taking a night walk during the day

--------------------------------------------------
Response:Yes, it's possible to remove the glue layer without it being applied to the clothes. To do this, you would first clean the fabric to remove any traces of glue, like a rag. Once the rag was clean, you could smooth it with a cotton ball until it is smooth and even. Then, you would press the rag down into the fabric.

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>Where is Malaysia?<response_prefix>Malaysia is a country in Southeast Asia, located in the Malay archipelago and bordering Thailand, Singapore, Brunei, and Indonesia.<prompt_prefix>What languages are spoken there?<response_prefix>There are many ethnic groups in Malaysia, and the majority of people speak the Malay language.  However, Malaysian also speak Mandarin, Tamil, and other languages.<prompt_prefix>I did not know that Tamil is spoken there.  How did it get there from India?<response_prefix>In the 1600s, the Mughal empire conquered northern India, but they took a liking to the Malays, so they imported Malay and Tamil workers to help manage the empire, and that is how Malay and Tamil made it to Malaysia.  The British and Dutch took control of Malaya in the 1800s, and so both Malay and Tamil were influenced by English, Dutch, and Hindi.  The British brought in more and more Indian workers as well, and some of them are part of the ethnic group that makes up the majority of people in Malaysia today.<prompt_prefix>How difficult is it to find people who speak English?<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:It is difficult to find people from a specific ethnic group.  One of the key factors is that only a few native speakers of the language are able to learn and express an accent in the English-speaking world. Moreover, the process of obtaining English is not easy, and it requires a high degree of training and qualifications.  This is why it takes a lot of effort to find native speakers of English, regardless of their language background. Moreover, many non-native speakers

--------------------------------------------------
Response:The plant is being drained, so it’s a good idea to drink water. You can also boil the plant and add it to your pot of water. It will help the water drain away some of the nutrients from the plant. After it has been boiled, the water has to return to the plant to rehydrate the roots and help the plant regenerate

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>I have a one-day layover in Hong Kong.  Is there anything worth seeing in the city?<response_prefix>Sure!  It’s a great city, with lots of fun things to do.  Here are three of my personal favorites:

1.  The flower market, where you can buy beautiful flowers for almost nothing.  You can also buy and eat all sorts of unusual fruits.
2.  The market by the harbour, which features lots of delicious foods.  You can find street food and restaurants as well as huge grocery stores and restaurants.
3.  Cat Street: it’s a street full of temples and meditation centres.  In the evening, everyone here just lights incense and meditates and you can feel the love and compassion coming off everyone.  It’s pretty special.<prompt_prefix>Perhaps I should join a tour group since I do not have a lot of time.  What do you think?<response_prefix>

Response:Absolutely!  There are so many amazing things to see and do in this city.  From exploring historical sites to street art, there’s something for everyone!

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>How do I gain confidence when asking someone out?<response_prefix>Well, I don’t think there’s a single “right way” to do that. But, my main recommendation would be to be honest about the situation you’re in, to explain why you want to ask someone out, and why that person is a good fit for you. Maybe even ask a friend to go with you.<prompt_prefix>Any other ideas?<response_prefix>Sure, there’s a few. I think it’s important to pick the right situation, which means a private setting with no people around that you know to the extent that they would gossip about you.  And in many cases, it’s nice to go out for dinner or coffee first, if that person is not available for a long-term date in the short term.<prompt_prefix>All right. What else can you tell me?<response_prefix>

Response:I’d suggest that you bring a few friends along, or even a small group of people who you really really want to be friends with. Just make sure there’s an atmosphere and that you’re really comfortable with the conversation and that everyone feels comfortable interacting with you.  Additionally, it may be helpful to keep an open mind, to enjoy the conversation with others, and to engage them in unexpected ways. Ultimately, it’s all about having fun, having fun with others and building camaraderie. Lastly, it’s important to respect boundaries and be respectful of the other person

Prompt:<prompt_prefix>Can you help me learn about detox juices?<response_prefix>Sure! There are lots of different opinions on how to make and use detox juices, but I can tell you that the basic idea of a detox juice is to mix certain vegetables and fruits, juice them together, and drink them throughout the day. When you do this, you should also pay attention to the quality of your diet and sleep, and eat at least 5 portions of a variety of fruits and vegetables each day.<prompt_prefix>What is it supposed to detox?<response_prefix>There are lots of opinions on this, but in general they’re detoxifying your liver.  Your liver is the main organ that metabolizes all the toxins and waste products your body produces. When you have a lot of toxins in your body, your liver needs to do more work to process them. This makes your liver less efficient at processing other things, and over time it can get tired.  When your liver gets tired, you have more toxins in your body, and your immune system doesn’t work as well.  Some people think that detox juices make your liver feel good again, and this is the main effect they have.<prompt_prefix>Can you give me an example of a detox juice recipe?<response_prefix>One popular detox juice recipe is this one: 1 apple, 2 carrots, 2 kale leaves, 1⁄2 cucumber, 1 cup ice. If you make this mixture and drink it all the time, some people say it will make your liver happy and make your body feel healthy.  There are also many different recipes for detox juices, so if you want to experiment, I can help you get started with detox juices.<prompt_prefix>Thank you.<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:You're welcome! It's always fun and easy to experiment with new recipes. And as someone who also specializes in detox food, I'm especially proud of the many vegan and gluten-free recipes out there that are great resources for making and eating well. Those are just some ideas – there are many other great options out there, and you can find them all at your local grocery store or online. Likewise, it's always important to follow your body's natural detoxing routines, so you're taking care of your body and mind, and

The goal is to create a deeper connection with our fellow human beings, and to promote empathy, compassion, and acceptance toward all
