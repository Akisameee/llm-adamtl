Prompt:<|endoftext|><prompt_prefix>Hi, I'd like to sell my old vinyl records on eBay. How do I do that?<response_prefix>Well you need to make a category for them in eBay, and a description for each one.  You can also upload pictures of the items, and write a description for each picture.  It might be nice to have some information about how old the records are, and perhaps you can rate them with a score.  You can also, for example, enter other information like price, condition, size, and whether they're in perfect condition or not.  See here for more information about what eBay considers “Seller’s Marks” -- that’s what you can say in your description of what each record is, and it's all entirely optional: http://help.ebay.com/customer/mail-thankyou/helpitem.html/29083/Condition-and-Collectibility<prompt_prefix>Thanks. Any tips for how to handle shipping. or how to get good prices for what I sell?<response_prefix>Hm, it's hard to say without knowing more about what you're selling.  It's probably a good idea to know the values of the records in advance, so that you can figure out a fair price before you start listing them.  You might be able to tell from the seller ratings of your records if they're worth a lot or not, but it could take some time to do research before you get a good idea of what to list them at.  What do you think you'd like to get out of the experience, and do you have a plan for how you'll sell the records?<prompt_prefix>I'm looking to make money, that's all. Any other tips?<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:If you're selling vinyl records, there are a lot of ways to make money: 
1. You could try to sell them on eBay and sell them for more or less than you're worth. 
2. You could sell your records to a lot of people and try to sell them for a good price. 
3. You could start a record store and sell your records online. 
4. You could sell you of your records online at a store or at a garage. 
I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help you with.<|endoftext|>

Prompt:<|endoftext|><prompt_prefix>How do I fix a running toilet?<response_prefix>Do you have any tools?<prompt_prefix>Yes, I have all of the tools here that I might need.<response_prefix>I would start by removing the covers that cover the pump and check it to see if it needs to be replaced. Then check to see if there are any leaks around the base of the toilet tank.  If there are no leaks, then I would turn the water off, and then remove the tank to see if there are any leaks at the base. If there are leaks, I would try to repair them with the tools I already have. If there are no leaks, then I would replace the tank.<prompt_prefix>Can you tell me about the different parts in the toilet tank that could be causing leaks.<response_prefix>Sure. The most important part is the flapper. It sits at the bottom of the tank and is lifted by the water pressure. A good way to test whether there is a leak at the base is to put water in the tank and look for any drips. It can be difficult to identify if the flapper isn’t sealing properly, but I can tell you that a failing flapper can be replaced.<prompt_prefix>Okay, I think I have a flapper that isn't sealing correctly. I will have to replace it to stop the leak.<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:Great. The next step is a good look around for the flapper. I will start by removing the bottom of the flapper, and then I will identify it by looking for any leaks. It will be difficult, but it’s important to identify the flapper and the leaks. I will then replace the flapper to the bottom and then remove the flapper to see if it’s sealing correctly.<|endoftext|>

--------------------------------------------------

The Illustrated Man is a series of short stories that tell the story of Rick Deckard, a Martian who is stranded on a Martian planet. The Martian Chronicles are set in a small town on Mars, and they are set in the story.<|endoftext|>

Prompt:<|endoftext|><prompt_prefix>How do I care for a wood table?<response_prefix>I’m a computer program, not a carpenter, but in general, wood tends to be a natural material that doesn’t need a lot of special care, other than some maintenance and a little wood oil every now and then to preserve its original color. Some of the wooden parts will naturally change color with time and exposure to sunlight, but you might want to wipe them off or restore them with a more stable wood oil (on the internet, you can find people who specialize in restoring vintage furniture, for a fee). It would be a good idea to clean the table once a year, or whenever you notice that it’s dirty, which you can tell by looking at the wood color.<prompt_prefix>Should I use a table cloth?<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:Yes, you should definitely use a table cloth, especially if you have a wooden table that you want to keep with you for an extended period of time. Some good options include tablecloths that have a natural color, or tablecloths with natural fibers, such as wool or synthetic fibers. It's also a good idea to use tablecloths that are clean, in good condition, and that are the same color as the wood you are using. Some popular brands for tablecloths include Marmot, Everlane, and Knoll. It's a good idea to find a table cloth that you can use for extended periods, as it can help keep the wood looking its best.<|endoftext|>

Prompt:<|endoftext|><prompt_prefix>How are LEDs made?<response_prefix>We’d need to define what a LED is to be sure, but generally speaking, an LED is a thin plastic tube that is typically coated with one of three metals, like indium or gallium.  Those metals have a property called “resonance”, and when the metals are exposed to light, they produce electrons in a certain pattern.  A light that flashes repeatedly, as in a strobe light, causes a fluorescent material inside the tube to glow, like you see in a traffic light.<prompt_prefix>Are they similar to a fluorescent bulb?<response_prefix>No, an LED is very different from a fluorescent bulb.  Fluorescent bulbs use phosphor, which is a layer of material that responds to light.  The bulb emits a light that you can see, but what makes it “fluorescent” is that the light is visible for a long time after the bulb has been turned off.  An LED bulb doesn’t emit light when it’s off, so you can’t tell if it’s working by looking at it.<prompt_prefix>Interesting! So an LED is more energy efficient than a fluorescent bulb?<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:Yes, an LED is more efficient than fluorescent bulbs.  LED’s energy efficiency is generally more than that of fluorescent bulbs, which can be very energy-intensive and consume a lot of energy.<|endoftext|>

Prompt:<|endoftext|><prompt_prefix>Where do I start to potty train my child?<response_prefix>I’m glad you asked.  I’m not sure if you’re looking to potty train your child, or if you want me to help you with it, but I’ll be happy to offer advice.  I can tell you that this is something you can do with a child as young as two.  Just like other behavior, your child learns it through repetition and practice.  You’ll want to teach your child to use the potty, before you do anything else.  So, start by taking your child to the potty about once an hour, after eating, drinking, and napping.  It’s important to be consistent with this.  Don’t let your child hold it, as this can cause constipation and irritable bowels.  And while you’re teaching your child, make sure you ask them if they’re trying to pee or poop and when they’re done.  Finally, make sure you put your child on the potty before any other activity, so they’re getting used to the feel and sounds of it.<prompt_prefix>When is a good age to start teaching him to be potty trained<response_prefix>
--------------------------------------------------
Response:It's important to start teaching your child to potty train before it's too late. Potty training is important for the child's growth and development, and it can help improve their behavior. It's also important to teach your child the potty train, so they feel comfortable and confident. It's also a good idea to have a child with potty issues or questions, so you can have them practice potty training with you and your child. Finally, it's important to make sure that your child is getting enough sleep, and that you're getting enough rest so that they can feel their full attention and attention to the potty.<|endoftext|>
